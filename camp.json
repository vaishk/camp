Multiple types of connections (video, audio, electrical), relationships between live and recorded material, and the various elements of the existing context, were brought into play. <br />\nThe principal types of links were: <br /> <br />\n\n1. About 80 short video clips were produced, at 9 or 10 different locations. These were viewable at the kiosk, by navigating through a set of pictures in a browser, a bit like on a website.   <br />\n2. Electrical connections were made between the kiosk and these locations, so as you watched the video one could also \"light up\" the house, street corner, etc. where the video was \"coming from\", or other locations visible from there. This was a parody or extreme case of \"mapping\". <br />\n3. Live audio was being mixed and broadcast on micro-fm, received on radios on the ground and in the flats. In this way the multiple locations could all hear the discussion at the kiosk. \n<br /><br />\n\nThanks to: <br />\n Vickram Crishna, Ravi Jagtiani, Sheikh Mohammed Shareef, Subhash, Ridhi D'cruz, Abhishikta Banerjee, Benson Almeida and Richard Fernandes and Celebrate Bandra.<br /><br />\n\nSpecial thanks to:<br />\nLal Bahadur Mastana, Rao family at Kalpak Hites, Lalu Yadav, Sarju Yadav, Savio, Ali Tiwari, Feroze Khan, Mukesh Rais, Ram Parvesh guards, Mr and Mrs Beg at Kismet, Raheja family at Sunflower, Mrs Bajaj at Jackers, Roshan Dabhoiwalla, Dosu Setna, Vidya Vaidya. <br />",

This will be the time for extended introductions to the participants, their background and experiences, and the questions that they bring to the table.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n(1) QUESTIONS OF ARCHIVE:<br />\n<br />\n~ to archive, to gather, to classify. <br />\n<br />\nArchiving can be described as a relation to objects that neglects, ignores, circumvents or transcends both their exchange value and their use value. In a world where most objects are - in rapid succession - bought, used and disposed of, the archivist appears as a rather strange figure. The act of archiving seems to be an almost utopian gesture: to take care of an object, to find a place for an object, to protect and preserve an object. But there are other sides: the destructive and mad side of archiving, the regressive or naive denial of exchange and use value, compulsive collections, casual collections, inevitable collections and more.  In this session we share specifics of why we (the group) archive, what we archive and in what ways we order or classify these collections.  <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n(2) CONFLICTS OF ACCESS:<br />\n<br />\n~ to explore, to navigate, to mine, to get lost, to stumble upon. <br />\n<br />\nConflicts of access arise in two different types. There are, very obviously, countless cases of denial of access - to information, resources, means of production or places, cases of structural, planned and persistent inaccessibility. There is also a political ideology of \"making accessible\" that denies the very common experience that access, in a simplistic, purely technical way, is never enough: that it is context that needs to be created, that it is an encounter that needs to be allowed for, that it is always collectivity, and production, rather than just individual consumption, that waits to emerge when people seek access to things.<br />\n<br />\nMany of the metaphors that have been used to describe the archive as a place, or as structure, are references to nature: the archive as a garden is a very old idea, in conflict with the archive as forest, or jungle. In contemporary times, the archive as a mine or farm speaks of a change in the nature of value in the archive, no longer residing in its actual contents, but in the ability to extract and  store visitor behaviour, and their patterns of interest. These are among other approaches to the question of access; such as the archive as river for instance, accepting the structure of the archive to be both directional and temporal, and taking into account phenomena such as driftwood, flooding, leaks, and even data loss.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n(3) INSTANCES OF ANXIETY<br />\n<br />\n~ to be archived, to control and be controlled, to erase, to market.<br />\n <br />\nThe archive presents a range of indexical options that may be exercised to tease apart or align identities, owners, co-ordinates, and objects. The potential for such control is a cause for anxiety, both in what is archived, and among archivists. Such questions arise, at one level, at the boundary of what is archived and how it is classified, or what it is searched by:  images by text, texts by author, video by source, location, and so on. At the same time, deeper patterns and consequences will accompany the publication of any archived material, in a context that is often not its \"original\" one, that may make it more or less vulnerable to censorship, \"personal offence\", and questions of property and propriety.  <br />\n<br />\nThis section would turn such fairly common experiences among video-makers, for example, into open questions for the archive.

It is also clear that acts of \"communication\" alone may not be enough to dissolve deeper boundaries. And then, which boundaries are worth dissolving? \nMuch of our ongoing work enters into this conceptual \nspace. <br /><br />\n\nA primary project of contemporary design is to keep things and people at a certain precise distance, so that the relationship may sit within a safe, acceptable range on the slider between the \"personal\" and the \"public\".\nIn this way the role of contemporary materials, interfaces and design strategies could be seen primarily as insulation,  sheltering us from the effects of unwanted attentions.\nIn many cases this shelter is necessary, since utter exposure, total publication, can be brutal. But what other ways can we imagine, to traverse these terms?<br /><br /> The workshop is about building upon such ideas  in terms of the practices of the artists and designers involved.

        "header": "After many meetings with various groups in the market, we decided to begin with \"micro cinema\" for the premiere soiree. We chose Mandabi, (Le Mandat In French), by one of Senegal's well known directors (and novelists), Ousmane Sembene.",
        "body": "Modibo D'awarre, a Senegalese filmmaker who had studied in FTII, Pune in the 90's had remarked in an earlier conversation: \"Directors like Sembene made subaltern cinema for bourgeois consumption. Their films followed in the tradition of the 'auteur' films, written, directed and produced by single individuals albeit with European funding.\" True, Sembene was Africa's export to world cinema, but like the films of Ray, were yet to be seen by the kind of audiences who constituted the subjects of their films.<br />\n\n<i>Mandabi</i>, The Money-Order (1968), his first film in Wolof, is very much in the tradition of our (Indian) social-realist parallel cinema of the late 60's and 70's. It tells the story of Dieng, a 'good Muslim' in Dakar who receives a money-order from his nephew who works in Paris. To get the letter read, he needs to pay someone. To cash the money-order, he needs a photo ID, for the ID he needs a birth certificate, and so on. The film unfolds across the slow and frustrating machinations of post-colonial bureaucracy even as the speedier 'social(ist)' norms of traditional and communal 'sharing' of the 'wealth' ensure that its well distributed and spent between wives, nephews, sisters, cousins, imams and corrupt officials. In all this humour and lightness are important characters, and distinguish this film from many others of its kind.<br /><br /> \n\nThe electricity for Soiree 1 had been provided by the director of the market, the genteel Abdoul Rahman-Ly who after agreeing had marched us into the office of the redevelopers to plug in. The men-folk had suggested Biscuiterie Rue-16 as the venue, one of the broader 'kognes' (lanes) leading of from the main road of the market. The screen was hung on the broad corner wall of a building from the balcony of a cousin of an old man Macky N'diaye who was surprising in his alacrity to get things done by 'giving' and not demanding. Sighting 'Toubab's' in the streets flush with European do-good funding was so commonplace in Dakar, it was to be a couple of days before the people at Marche N'Gellaw would begin to trust us, and give the project a different reading. For now, it seemed customary to ask for money, even though we would explain that the 'charge' was on the donor, via other currencies like electricity for the battery or other requirements like large speakers or a wall for the screenings. <br /><br />\n\nA large contingent of women arrived at 7:15; they were the women from the upstairs vegetable market who we had invited during an earlier rendezvous. Some came with radios, as we had mentioned FM at the meeting. A small FM antenna had been strung on a light pole, and the near-by shops were all requested to tune-in to 103 FM. A white board listed the Xew Xew (event) of the evening, with special guest Dj Amala (Radio Dakar) and the names of the people who had contributed 'courrant and recharge', in this case Abdoul Rahman-Ly, Macky N'diaye(for the balcony wall and for subsequent week long storage of mats and our equipment table) and Abdul Cisse from the fabric shop next door --we began running out of juice soon after DVD 1, there were about a hundred people into the movie, Cisse who had been watching from his shop counter was quick to plug the power and keep the projector going--",

Working together since march 2008, we have been thinking through questions of \"citizenship\" and distribution by looking at how residents form relationships with water and its infrastructures: including official water supply, alternative plumbing, ground water, tanker politics, and so on. The group has been meeting every possible Sunday since March 2008. Writing, shooting and some rough cuts of the videos were finished by June 2008. <br /><br />\n\nAs the name of the project suggests, water has several narrative flows, multiple scales and notes attached. The group has been shooting on their own, bringing their footage into a collective pool, writing over images in analytical, diarisitic or essay styles.

        "body": "We moved 2 kognes up to Bisuiterie rue 18. With 7-8 electronic shops selling transistor radios and copying tapes, it seemed right for a micro radio event. The antenna went up on the first floor balcony of the 'Centre pour le suive scholaires apres l'ecole', an after-school 'school'. Recharge was provided by Diop et Freres, who also had a tuner (radio) connected to large speakers. About 15 radios in the lane tuned in to marche N'Gellaw-1 103.FM hosted by DJ Amala. From the battery-powered radio station at the street corner, Amala wielded a 100 mtr XLR cable from shop to shop indulging in conversation about neighbours, livelihoods, occupations, wishes and music requests.<br /><br />\n\nA couple of hours into the 'show' (a car battery can power this kind of FM transmission all night if need be!) we were greeted by a special guest, Amadou Kane (namaste, mein Mohammed Khan!), who runs a TV show called <i>Allo Bombay</i>. Allo Bombay and DJ Amala engage in a impromptu \"interview\" in the middle of the street intersection, broadcast upto about 50 metres away. Allo Bombay and DJ Amala engage in a impromptu \"interview\" in the middle of the street intersection, broadcast upto about 50 metres away. We had met Amadou Kane earlier in the week, he had floored us with his perfect hindi, when asked how he had learnt to speak so fluently, he had replied, <i>\"Jab aadmi bachpan se kuch seekhta hai, to sahi tereh se seekta hai, Main bachpan se bollywood dekta aa raha hoon\"</i> <br /> <br />With no shared colonial past, having never been to India, his and others' Hindi was a revelation of sorts. In our first week in Dakar, we had been accosted by people on the street who would enquire if I was 'hindou'(meaning Indian). On nodding they would break into dance or exclaim, Ah, beautiful, We remember Mangala! Mangala, it turned out was the name of the actress Nimmi in <i>Aan</i> (1952, the first Hindi film to have a worldwide release) a film that had run for months in Senegal, which in the time of Senegals first president Leopold Senghor (author of negritude), and president from 1960 to 1980 saw a steady distribution and import of Hindi cinema. 20 percent of spending went to culture we were told, Dakar had dozens of cinema's. Now, close to two decades since structural adjustments, empty shells of grandeur and desire dot the neighbourhood...al Mansoor, Rahman...the one on jet d'eau had become a church of some preaching cult...the only cinema that bore semblance of activity was liberte, which was screening Dil to Pagal Hai(on DVD) and a dated Hollywood action flick.(Kane aka Allo Bombay later told us that he supplied liberte with his collection of Hindi movies on DVD) <br /><br />\n\n",

Not entirely surprising, Arcelor-Mittal was already mining iron-ore in Senegal, TATA buses were plying on their new roads and later that week we met the proprietor of the sole Indian restaurant who among other trades and deals like importing Bajaj bikes was looking to import Su-Kam inverters from India as Senegal with its electricity shortage seemed a likely market.<br><br>Ramata, began walking down the lane, singing a song, her voice resounded in different pockets and corners of the lane. Soon she appeared in the clearing on the main road, in a dazzling violet sequined sari! Her cohort jumped out and did a comedy skit after which to everyones surprise Ramata's daughter came dancing out of a shop in a violet organza salwaar-kameez and veil and performed a duet with Ramata to a song from <i>Nagin</i>. Through the evening they regaled the neighbours with comedy skits including a 'sharabi' act in Hindi with due credit to Bollywood, a break dance competition for the kids....at close to 9, the battery began to beep and the performance slowly wound down to an end.

On the morning of Soiree 4,  when we were out on our charging rounds people had not seemed exactly overjoyed at our announcement of a Wolof film, you had promised an Indian film they said. We had to agree, but where would we get films on such short notice? 'Around the kogne', we were told and we were led back to the shop of the father of Diop et freres (who repaired electronics). Out of a drawer came out over 50 films, in the all too familiar polythene bags...we bought <i>Pukar, Don, Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Fakeera</i> (1976) which seemed to be another well-watched and remembered film. It had been hard chosing the film for the evening, it was a toss-up between <i>Fakeera</i> and another very popular film. Even though they both had French subtitles, the majority of the public would not be reading them. Too often we had been told, 'well show them anything, they can consume it all', and we had been offended by this attitude among the Senegalese (and of course French)cultural elites. <br /><br />\n\nDetermined not to let it disintegrate into just a spectacle we began by deconstructing and describing the film scene by scene. I would comment in English and Amala would translate into Wolof. By the time the title sequence of <i>Amar Akbar Anthony</i> hit the screens (some 20 minutes into the film), the story had gotten too convoluted and too unbelievable to explain, any attempts at articulation would be reductive. Hindi cinema is an immersive spectacle whose narrative language transcends logic and belief. <i>Amar Akbar Anthony</i> is a film that had run for weeks in Dakar, its title song still being sung by anyone old enough to recollect.  A trip down the years for many in the audience, who remembered nostalgically their weekend escapes into Hindi cinema.<br /><br /> \n\nThis time we had tied the screen across the road. A 2-way screen with a 2-way audience. Diop et Freres's speaker/tuner system provided ample sound from across the road and his father's shop covered the spread inside the lane and also doubled up as a viewing gallery.Several smaller radios dotted the floor.  Of course, in lieu of the epic length, we had to charge two batteries! We still ran out of juice mid-way through the 2nd half and drew the charge from the shop of Amadou Diallo next door. \n\n",

        "body": "(The screening schedule can be found by clicking on the tab above.) <br /><br />\n\nIf there are (by a rough count) some 3000 \"security\" cameras in the Bombay suburb of Bandra West where we live, what could this mean for practices of image-making? <br /><br />\nIn one way, it means nothing: these are images born into another world of the image, in which they then circulate, alone. They do not mix easily with other images, they are generally short-lived (the cheapest and most common CCTV systems don't record anything, and in the ones that do, images are being constantly overwritten, often by law). These image collections are then a continuously looping \"backup\": a bit like if we were recording TV all the time, in the hope that we will find something interesting in it, next week. Once in a while, a few images will indeed be pulled out as \"evidence\", or a video clip will leak out onto television or youtube. But these moments are brief, and their role is familiar. What is much stranger is that we live continuously in a Ghost City of images. This cloud taps us gently on the shoulder as we move about, but its own full reality or depth is something we are unable to grasp.  <br /><br />\n\nThe (eco)system of video as a security \"medium\" creates, and actually is founded upon, a vast material excess. This surplus is not only in the sense that these images exceed language, commodity and so on, but also that in a very physical way, these are a lot of images. Yet their  ghostly mass appears to lie beyond simple notions of the extraction of utility or value from it. (For example it often acts outside of itself, as a \"deterrent\", or as a body-in-waiting for an event that never actually happens.) We could say that this hidden material possesses \"abuse-value\" - a taking without giving, a one-way utility that precedes other forms of value. [1]\n<br /><br />\n\nNow, a glut in the images folder is not unfamiliar to contemporary image-makers. Filmmakers and photographers working \"digitally\" are quite aware that ours is a materially excessive practice, even compared to a few years ago. There is a growing \"digital divide\" between the shots that have been \"taken\", and those that may eventually resurface as films, exhibitions, online or in any other form. We are realising also that this abundance is not \"free\", there is a lot of cameras, tapes, hard-drives, storage space and time being spent on it. But this will not slow us down. So what are the real and psychic dimensions of this excessiveness? What is happening as we gather things we cannot possibly use? Put differently, what is happening as we collectively wait, for the on-camera event that will justify the expense, and sate our current curiosities? On the one hand this is a space of potential, the reverse side of production. But it is also the dark side of the \"democratisation\" of video, and \"access\" to its tools, claimed in so many places since the 90's. The waiting game is most effectively seen in Indian television today: in all those cameras ready to pounce upon the shadow of an event, and the ultimate in money-shot camera-tricks, the sting operation. The use of such imaging is justified always by good intentions, and \"greater concerns\" of the \"public\". But this is the language of the police, and so the search for even better justifications, even nobler intentions in the realm of professional imaging, is perhaps the wrong one. <br /><br />\n\nIf we can temporarily suspend the good intentions and diverse subject positions of various agents \"making films\", producing image-narratives and so on, we have some more options: we could propose for example that video is a substance, a bit like electricity or water, or like refrigeration or LPG, or like a fog or sewage, in the urban bloodstream. Now if water produces a number of chemical solutions and cleansing rites, if electricity leads to communism or to \"Shakti-Anantam\" (depending on if you follow Lenin or Modi), and if LPG is at the heart of food, the national oil policy, and cylinder-bombs... where exactly does such video lead us? Does it lead the way to \"understanding\", \"safety\", \"our voices\" or \"voyeurism\"? This is not a \"modernist\" deterministic question, it is a question for the democracy of images. Is it merely inevitable that everyone will watch everyone else? What happens next? How can we distinguish images used by the police from the ones offered in friendship? How do we recognise \"abuse-value\"? The only way perhaps is to go deeper into the conditions in which video is made, with or without human intention, with or without our consent. This is where security video may lead the way, because it has already entered into such material territory, and into various still-debated positions of the subject. Moreover, it may allow the time, more than any other form, to ponder all of these questions. Closer to the ground into which such video is embedded, we see \"secondary\" effects: what is being redistributed here is not only views or watching power, but a gradual realignment of abilities and senses... not all of which are well understood, or can be accounted for by the term \"surveillance\" or its counter-theories (exhibitionism, sousveillance, and so on).\n <br /><br />\n\nIn the case of the bandra shopkeepers for example, the CCTV system appears to be a form of inattentive TV-watching. But it is also psychically linked to older constructions of glass and mirrors; entire architectures by which corners would be turned, employees watched, goods doubled, glimpses stolen of the clouds and of the traffic outside... all the while carefully avoiding the traumatic geometry (for the shopkeeper) of having to look at oneself in a mirror all day. Interior designers know this... but who knows the genetic effects of a couple of generations of mirror watching, or being watched? In what ways do these images now enter the mindscape of professional waiting, what spaces of reflection are now opened up, what dreams or nightmares could follow?  <br /><br />\n\nAt the other end of the stick, as it were, in the control rooms of large CCTV systems there are other lineages, other openings. Working-class operators train to be \"cameramen\", learn framing and following techniques, turn into habit the legally-defined limits of zooming in and zooming out. They watch people and neighborhoods that become increasingly familiar, at a distance. Over time, this becomes mechanical and lonely, but this is also a loneliness continuously expecting, seeking, the Big Event: a breakdown in the social world one has \"left\" outside, an overflow of the simultaneous enjoyments of voyeurism and duty.\n<br /><br />\n\nIn such infrastructures then, just as when other technologies become settled or pervasive, the ability to act and to produce meaning (what is called \"agency\"), has shifted from the old places, has become intertwined with changing technology and context, has changed size or shape. Where has it gone to? What does it look like? The videos presented here attempt to answer these questions, through the work of artists who have engaged with this \"medium\" for some time.\n<br /><br />\nThese are artists going hard at images, a quite different idea from the artist as a person \"taking the picture\", \"making the picture\", or even \"assembling\" a picture. This work attempts to simultaneously challenge and produce the conditions in which such a picture can be \"taken\" (ingested, assimilated, revealed).  It is here a question of disrupting the order of images, in order to produce one's own.\n<br /><br />\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Found footage\u00e2\u20ac\u009d can now be seen as a somewhat quaint term. It is obvious that such footage is not \"found\", as if somehow lying on the road, but is actively sought out, negotiated, stolen, bought, and so on. If the term \"found footage\" came from art history's found-objects, or objet-trouve, it appears today that footage-objects are part of a much more protected domain of material life, in which they must be extracted from regimes of the not-for-your-eyes, borrowed from the \"belongings\" of someone else, and then purified, sexualized, exposed, re-buried, suspended, replayed or dispersed anew.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nFor us (CAMP) this approach is related to ongoing work around technical infrastructures. The work with video is an attempt to open up a space, in our context, outside of documentary films, television or popular cinema as the default triumvirate of sites for both the production and understanding of images, as \"father figures\" for all other moving-images. The point is not so much that CCTV video will enter into the art world (as it has) or that there will be Bollywood films shot with it (there are, and there will be more), but that strategic traversals of these fields can create an energy, a politics. It may be eventually that the non-overlap, or lack of commonality, of security images with more traditional ones is what needs to be sustained, to render \"inoperable\" (in Jean-Luc Nancy's sense of a community based on unharmony) our growing community of images.\n<br /><br />\nThe ongoing series around Video Art is similarly an attempt to tease apart these two  words, to expand the category they enclose, to populate the boundaries of what a video art can be. \n<br /><br />\n(p.s. the artists here don't necessarily share our views on the above. As before, the majority of these works are found online, there is one exception.)<br /><br />\n\nNotes:<br />\n\n(1) Abuse-value has been used in atleast two different contexts: by Michel Serres in writing about \"parasitic\" abuse value, as an \"arrow with only one direction\", a taking without giving back. This can also have its positive, or fortunate side. And by Arthur Kroker and Michael Weinstein more negatively as the \"last\" value that may be extracted from the weak and oppressed.  Here it is used more in Serres' sense. <br />",
        "schedule": "<b>I Thought I was Seeing Convicts </b> <br />\nHarun Farocki (2000)<br />\n25 mins <br />\n\nThe film borrows its title from a dialogue in a Rossellini film, Europa 51, where Irene (Ingrid Bergman) a wealthy lady, goes to work in a factory for a day to find it like a prison. Here, as you watch prisoners meet their loved ones, or get set up in a 'playground' for a fight, the surveillance visuals become images that allow for a perverse humanisation of the prisoners, just as you are reminded that in this space the field of vision and the field of fire literally coincide.\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>The Great Indian School Show </b> <br />\nAvinash Deshpande (2005)<br />\nExcerpt: 20 mins. <br />\nExcerpts from Deshpande's film, which not only allegorises  control as a requisite for new nation building, replacing the state with private law and discipline, but also because it shows us one logical extreme of  the 'democratic' access to technology. This is the story of Mahatma Gandhi High School in Nagpur, which had installed 185 security cameras, with the principal's chamber as the control room. <br /><br />\n\n<b>Scenes from the Neighbourhood</b>: Neelam, Royal, China Gate, et tu Janta? <br />\nCAMP (2008)<br />\n5 mins. <br />\nGlimpses of CAMP work with security video in new \"settings\" in our neighbourhood. <br /><br />\n\n<b>Khirkeeyaan </b> <br />\nShaina Anand (2006) <br />\nExcerpt 10 mins. <br />\nKhirkeeyaan achieves a radical inversion of CCTV's apparatus: cameras and mikes are cross-linked through a standard CCTV box, to create a conversational space using household TV's. A number of different installations or \"episodes\" in Khirkee village, Delhi were staged, ranging from an onscreen meeting of Nepali household help and the landed elite's \"bahuraniyan\", to a doctor giving dubious advice, to barber shops and political debate, to four basement factories and their workers being exposed to each other. \n\n<br /><br />\n<b>CCTV Social:</b>Clinic and Regeneration. <br />\nShaina Anand (2008) <br />\nexcerpts 15 mins <br />\nIn March 2008, Shaina Anand's project opened CCTV control rooms in Manchester to members of the general public, who signed up for one hour \"therapy\" sessions. About 40 people spent an hour each in control rooms where Manchester's Open Street Surveillance was in action. In the Arndale, one of Europe's largest malls and the site of the 1996 IRA bombing that \"saved Manchester\" (by kick-starting its regeneration program) about a hundred people signed image-realease forms, to allow their images from the 206 cameras in the mall to be used, for a film that is under production. \n\n<br /><br />\n<b>Faceless</b>: Spectral Children <br />\nManu Luksch (2006)<br />\n15 mins.  <br />\nFACELESS was produced under the rules of the 'Manifesto for CCTV Filmmakers'. The manifesto states, amongst other things, that additional cameras are not permitted at filming locations, as omnipresent video surveillance is already in operation. Filmmaker Manu Luksch exploited a clause in the UK Data protection act that allowed an individual access to their own footage from the Operating agency, for a processing fee of \u00c2\u00a310. The Privacy law demanded that all other indentifiable people in the visuals had to be blacked out or blurred. After copious exchanges over several years, Luksch had \"recovered\" enough footage of herself and other actors  to create Faceless, a sci-fi fairy tale about a world where everyone lives in real-time, without memories...Spectral Children is a shorter installation version. \n<br /><br />\n<b>Video Sniffing.</b><br />\nMediashed (2007) <br />\nExcerpt 5 mins. <br />\nCapturing the images of of a CCTV system from outside it, and some performances around this practice. \n<br /><br />\n<b>Evidence Locker: Trust </b><br />\nJill Magid  (2005) <br />\n15 mins.<br />\n\nInstead of portraying the civilian as hapless victim of state surveillance, Magid's works attempt reversals by drawing the observers/police into personal relationships, flirtations, unexpected intimacies. In Evidence Locker, she successfully tweaks the function of Liverpool's city-wide surveillance system (the largest of its kind in England) by having the operators follow her around as she got to know them. For access to this footage, Magid had to submit 31 Subject Access Request Forms, which she wrote as though they were letters to a lover, expressing how she was feeling and what she was thinking. In the video Trust, Magid on the phone, eyes tightly closed, asks the CCTV operator to guide her through a busy city street.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>Nightwatch</b><br />\nFrancis Alys (2004)<br />\n15 mins. <br />\n\nOne night in 2004, Alys set loose a fox inside the National Portrait Gallery in London, and filmed the results using the gallery's security system. \n  <br /><br />\n\n",

        "body": "<br />There are currently about 60 million internet users in India. By the end of this year, it is estimated that there will be 300 million mobile phone users in the country. The mobile phone network, with its Value-Added-Services, SMS contests, Voice Portals, etc. and widespread use in lower-income communities, appears to already supersede the internet as a primary technological infrastructure.<br />This is the logic which is assumed by many technology startups in the mobile space. But what are the underlying technologies being used, and what other consequences and yet-unknown possibilities do they open up? <br /><br />For example how it possible to get your own space on this network (as you are able to host a website)? What are the technical, legal and social implications of connecting the IP-based computer networks and the mobile phone networks (and what is the status of hybrid VoIP services, or wi-fi on phones for example). <br /><br />To take us through the process of connecting cell phones to&nbsp; computers, as a key technical component of this possibility, CAMP is happy to announce a presentation/ workshop with Giovanni Maruzzelli from <a href=\"http://celliax.org\" title=\"Celliax \">http://celliax.org</a>.<br /><br />The workshop is technical in nature, but non-tech people interested in the space are welcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Workshop Timings: 6:30-9pm, Monday, 20th October.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Venue: CAMP Studio, Chuim Village, Khar. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; email <a href=\"http://camputer.org/?show=contact\">info@camputer.org</a> for directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2-hour workshop will include:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&gt; An introduction to Asterisk, the open source telephony server - what asterisk can do, applications of a telephony server, basic setup and configuration. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&gt;&nbsp; an explanation of the driver (chan_celliax) Giovanni has written to be able to connect Asterisk to most regular cell-phones. Also brief introduction to the driver for Skype. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&gt; A hands-on session where we connect a cell-phone to a computer and setup a simple real-world application on Asterisk using voice-based menus and / or SMS.<br /><br />&nbsp;This is short notice, but if you've had an idea for something you've wanted to do with an SMS or voice-based service, or just something fun you'd like to try with such a system, do send it in, and we'll try and incorporate it into our plan for the workshop and follow-up events. <br /><br />",

        "body": "<br /><span style=\"color: orange;\">Pirate Cinema</span><br />Not just a series of screenings, or a collection of pirated movies, but the<br />question of making visible, and then temporarily obsolete, a specific social<br />relation, mediated by copyrighted images, and a specific type of separation,<br />or detachment, perfected by imaginary copyrights, that affects the art of<br />cinema, the space of cinema, and the discourse of cinema. Unlike New Cinema,<br />which is opposed to Old Cinema, Alternative Cinema, which is opposed to<br />Mainstream Cinema, Political Cinema, which is opposed to Unpolitical Cinema,<br />French Cinema, which is opposed to American Cinema, or Digital Cinema, which is<br />opposed to nothing at all, Pirate Cinema is opposed to Proprietary Cinema.<br /><br style=\"color: orange;\" /><span style=\"color: orange;\">Pirate Cinema Bombay</span><br />Not just a rooftop, even though that's not the least of it. Most obviously, a<br />problem of transportation and translation. Pirate Cinema, unlike a pirated<br />movie, does not travel easily, it cannot be exported, imported, airlifted,<br />airdropped. It can't be booked, it won't be able to fill a space in the arts, or<br />a certain vacuum in arthouse. In the best case, it will itself create a vacuum.<br />Pirate Cinema can be translated, but not literally, and probably not by Pirate<br />Cinema, and it can be copied, but not without a particular kind of pragmatism,<br />or tactical ignorance, which itself would have to be copied, or translated. One<br />can say: \"The Beverly Hills of Bollywood\", but the question is, then what?<br /><br /><span style=\"color: orange;\">Pirate Cinema Bombay Sneak Preview</span><br />Not just a sneak preview, or rather not a sneak preview at all, not in the sense<br />that most of the images to be projected would reappear again. Still, it's a<br />hint, and still, there's a story, a hint at a story, or history within cinema,<br />which is sometimes even a history without cinema, and almost always a history<br />slightly outside cinema, just enough to make retrospective impossible, and<br />instead allow for preview. The story itself - how does one translate \"punk\"<br />again, to hindi... ah, we forgot, one doesn't - begins in the west, and then<br />goes east, and back in time. This screening, unlike some that will follow, is<br />much more encyclopedia than pedagogy.

They make movies here. I live here.<br />\n<br />\nSometimes I think that gives me the right to criticize the way movies depict my city.<br />\n<br />\nI know it's not easy. The city is big. The image is small. Movies are vertical.<br />\nAt least when they're projected on a screen. The city is horizontal, except for what we call downtown. Maybe that's why the movies love downtown more than we do. If it isn't the site of the action, they try to stick its high-rise towers in the back of the shot.<br />\n<br />\nBut movies have some advantages over us.<br />\n<br />\nThey can fly through the air. We must travel by land.<br />\n<br />\nThey exist in space. We live and die in time.<br />\n<br />\nSo why should I be generous?<br />\n<br />\nOf course, I know movies aren't about places, they're about stories. If we notice the location, we are not really watching the movie. It's what's up front that counts. Movies bury their traces, choosing for us what to watch, then moving on to something else.<br />\n<br />\nThey do the work of our voluntary attention, and so we must suppress that faculty as we watch. Our involuntary attention must come to the fore.<br />\n<br />\nBut what if we watch with our voluntary attention, instead of letting the movies direct us?<br />\n<br />\nIf we can appreciate documentaries for their dramatic qualities, perhaps we can appreciate fiction films for their documentary revelations.<br />\n<br />\nAnd what if suspense is just another alienation effect. Isn't that what Hitchcock taught? For him, suspense was a means of enlivening his touristy<br />\ntravelogues. Then maybe I can find another way to animate this city symphony in reverse. Maybe this effort to see how movies depict Los Angeles may seem more than wrong-headed or mean-spirited.<br />\n<br />\nFull script:<br />\n &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=\"http://newfilmkritik.de/archiv/2005-03/los-angeles-plays-itself/\" target=\"_blank\">http://newfilmkritik.de/<wbr>archiv/2005-03/los-angeles-<wbr>plays-itself/</a><br />\nList of references:<br />\n &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379357/movieconnections\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.imdb.com/title/<wbr>tt0379357/movieconnections</a><br />\nReview by Jonathan Rosenbaum:<br />\n &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/2004/1004/041001.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.chicagoreader.com/<wbr>movies/archives/2004/1004/<wbr>041001.html</a><br />\n",

And A REPORT <a href=\"http://camputer.org/event.php?id=75&amp;tab=optBtn2\">here</a>.)<br /><br />We take great pleasure in inviting you to a day-long engagement with Pad.ma. <br /><br /><br />For\nthe past year, we (Oil21 from Berlin, the Alternative Law Forum from\nBangalore, and three organisations from Bombay: Majlis, Point of View\nand ChitraKarKhana/CAMP) have been working on various aspects of the\nonline archive, <a href=\"http://pad.ma/\" target=\"_blank\">http://pad.ma</a>. At the moment Pad.ma contains some 150 hours of video and over 100,000 annotations (text entries).<br />\n<br />In its traditional function as an archive, we see Pad.ma as a way of opening up images, meanings\nand effects that are present in video footage and at the time of its shooting. These are resources that conventions of editing and viewing moving images have tended\nto suppress. <br />At the same time, Pad.ma responds to the invitation and challenge\nof a landscape beyond \"the film\" as the desired end-product of this\nmedium, and beyond youtube as its default online repository.&nbsp;\nFilmmakers and others are already engaged in many forms of\npresentation, interpretation, and the combination of images and ideas.\nPad.ma suggests some specific new relations between images and text,\nproduction and commentary, and online and offline.&nbsp; It proposes a few new ways to write about and discuss\ndocumentary film practice, ways to base academic work on video sources,\nand more generally, ways to still care for something that has become\n\"democratic\".&nbsp; All of these claims, ofcourse, will be tested in\nPad.ma's new phase.<br />\n<br />In March this year, Pad.ma will be opened up to external\ncontributions. As a lead-up to this, we invited a number of \"users\":\nindependent filmmakers, artists, activists, researchers, students, scholars, and enthusiasts\nto contribute their own material into <a href=\"http://pad.ma/\" target=\"_blank\">pad.ma</a>,&nbsp; or traverse the archive and explore its ways. <br />\n<br />On the 16th of February, we are having a day-long series of\npresentations and discussions with this group. We hope you will join us\nand take part, to understand the activities over the past year, and to\nhelp us plan the road ahead.<br />\n<br />with love, <br />pad.ma group:<br /><br />\n<a href=\"http://altlawforum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">altlawforum.org</a><br />\n<a href=\"../\" target=\"_blank\">camputer.org</a><br />\n\n<a href=\"http://chitrakarkhana.net/\" target=\"_blank\">chitrakarkhana.net</a><br />\n\n<a href=\"http://majlisbombay.org/\" target=\"_blank\">majlisbombay.org</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://oil21.org/\" target=\"_blank\">oil21.org</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://pointofview.org/\" target=\"_blank\">pointofview.org</a><br /><br />Speakers:<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Aagaaz</span> is a voluntary youth group whose members come from PremNagar, Meghwadi and SanjayNagar bastis of Jogeshwari, Mumbai from diverse religious and caste backgrounds.

        "opttext2": "\n    Report on Pad.ma 2009 Event. \n\n    On the 16th of February 2009, we officially opened out Pad.ma to the general public, and as a part of the launch we had a stimulating day-long event with various people who have been engaging with pad.ma. This report attempts to capture a sense of the day, as well as some of the questions and concerns that were raised. We were very excited by the range of responses, and ways in which people had used pad.ma in interpreting their own footage, revisiting their earlier work or annotating archived material, as well as the newer ways in which pad.ma were revealed for us through its use by this new set of participants. \n\n    Shaina Anand began the day by providing a background to pad.ma, and how the various organizations involved (Oil21 from Berlin, Alternative Law Forum, Bangalore, and three organizations from Bombay: Majlis, Point of View and ChitraKarKhana/CAMP) came together to conceptualize pad.ma. In its one year of making, pad.ma has already included over 150 \"events\" from Majlis's Godaam archive, Chitrakarkhana's collection of micro media and other contributions including that of Point of View, Alternative Law Forum and footage by filmmakers such at T. Jayashree and Saeed Mirza. Shaina said that the main reason for this day was to get a sense of how people from different disciplinary backgrounds from film makers to artists, and scholars to activists could use pad.ma to explore the relationship between text and image, to examine the possibilities that it opens up, and also to look at the blurring lines between those who produce images, those who interpret it, and those who are supposed to consume it.\n\n    The first presentation of the day was made by Aagaz, a voluntary youth group from PremNagar, Meghwadi and Sanjay Nagar bastis of Jogeshwari. Members of Aagaz including Shaali Shaikh, Durga Gudillu and Ismail Sharif spoke about the recent use of video in their work. About 15 hours of footage from their video project Ek Dozen Pani was collaboratively annotated to describe some relationships between infrastructure, water and the city. While infrastructure is hyper visible in most cities in diverse forms, from the rapidly changing built environment to decaying pipes from which water leaks to poorer neighborhoods, the members of Aagaz used the layers of annotation in pad.ma to go deep into their own histories of how infrastructure gets to be made and unmade in urban experience. <a href=\"http://pad.ma/find?l=Lj\">http://pad.ma/find?l=Lj</a>\n\n    Sanjay Kak spoke about his own relationship to found footage after the experience of making the film Jashn-e-Azadi, and he was invited to write over a two-hour long tape of found footage, \"Flight over the CFL\". In what can only be described as an ethnography of a media event, Sanjay Kak's reading of this film opens out for us the historical and analytical possibilities that lie in material which may seem completely ordinary and uneventful. Combining the skills of a film maker with that of the historian, Sanjay's contemporatry reading of the material  opened out ways in which we can think the relationship between events, fragmentary material and contested political histories <a href=\"http://pad.ma/Vg92c17o/info\">http://pad.ma/Vg92c17o/info</a>\n\n    Priya Sen, a film maker from Delhi revisited a film that she had made six years ago,\"The Knower of Secrets\" about Qawwali singers in Hazrat Nizamuddin. In her annotations, Priya looked at what it would mean to capture the experience of the film maker in the making of the film, an experience which is never exhausted by the end product that emerges in the form of the finished film. Her annotation moves between the personal, the affective, the theoretical and the analytical. On Pad.ma, the knower of secrets emerges as a text which opens out to different registers of experience and reflection which were not immediately available at the time of the making, or viewing, the film. <a href=\"http://pad.ma/Vu5mgs8w/info\">http://pad.ma/Vu5mgs8w/info</a>\n\n    Nida Ghouse's presentation raised the critical question of the difference between seeing an image, reading an image and understanding the experience of pad.ma which attempts to bring text and image together. Nida located the development of the various versions of pad.ma and its implications for newer forms of reading that are made available. Finally, Nida looked at the idea of the electronic archive not just as an archeological site for data mining, but also as a construction site of ideas and possibilities.\n\n    Sebastian L\u00c3\u00bctgert and Jan Gerber made 10 remarks about video and the internet, balancing between the exhilaration about video on the net and the material realities of low bandwidth.  They distinguished between open source as a 'cool attitude' and openness as a form of practice that constantly requires interventions that reframes the ways we think of our own practices. They also argued that licenses are 'real', in that issues of format of videos, inter-operability etc are all affected by proprietary licenses and the future of video on the net is also an issue about closed or open systems.\n\n    Kaushik Bhowmick was invited by pad.ma to be a guest annotator, and Kaushik took up the challenge by trawling through the archive and selecting ten events. But rather than choosing to annotate them through information or analysis of the events (which ranged from bar dancers to the item song in hindi films to the \"lumpen audience\"), Kaushik chose to read and write across them. Drawing from mythology and film theory, Kaushik chose to make poetic connections across images. Arguing that film eventually relies on the production of sensibilities, Kaushik's annotations sought to capture feelings and layers of the videos, and the ways they spoke to each other. <a href=\"http://pad.ma/Vejbx6uz/00:02:54.000\">http://pad.ma/Vejbx6uz/00:02:54.000</a>\n\n\n    Desire Machine Collective from Guwahati chose to focus on the idea of the North East as it emerges in popular discourse and in the news media. They curated a set of items which provided a name and place to the idea of the north east. In their curation they sought to raise the question of how an idea like the Northeast comes into being, where it finds form in media discourse, and also ways in which a counter archive that displaces one central idea of the north east could emerge. They chose to work with one segment of a film Tango Charlie and its hugely stereotypical image of the north east and contrasted this with videos that looked at the Bnei Menashe, the lost tribes of Israel from Mizoram.  ( http://pad.ma/find?l=Ll)\n\n\n    Lawrence Liang made a presentation on the relationship between the image, politics and the distribution of the sensible. Drawing form Jacques Ranciere, Lawrence argued that politics was already aesthetics, in that ideas of the political often draw from sensorial metaphors such as visibility and invisibility, and politics may consist of interruptions/interventions in the distribution of the sensible, which modify the aesthetico-political field. He tried to link this to an understanding of the political which is not dependent on a pre-determined political field, but which is open to redefinition through a reversal of assumptions of social roles. In the case of pad.ma, the blurring of the lines between image makers and image \"readers\" would constitute such an aesthetic-political interruption.\n\n    Ayisha Abraham who has made a film Straight 8 using found footage chose to look at rare films made on Ram Gopal, a dancer who became famous in the mid-twentieth century. Using the footage of Ram Gopal that had been shot by an amateur film maker Tom D'Aguiar, perhaps the only existing fragment of moving image of Ram, Ayesha posed questions about the relationship between the materiality of film, the role of archives and the reconstruction of histories through them. <a href=\"http://pad.ma/Vsnjewdj/info\">http://pad.ma/Vsnjewdj/info</a>\n\n    Ranu Ghosh has been working on the changing urban landscape of Kolkata, looking at the emergence of new high rise apartments against the decaying landscape of factories that have shut down. In her presentation she spoke about the South City project which has emerged on the lands of the Usha sewing machine factory. She showed a film that documents struggle of an individual against the acquisition of his housing quarters, he was given a camera to document what was happening, since there are no visitors allowed inside the premises. <a href =\"http://pad.ma/Vfsgvjes/info\">http://pad.ma/Vfsgvjes/info</a>\n\n    Nilanjan Bhattacharya has been working on questions of traditional knowledge and biodiversity. He presented an interview with Madhav Gadgil and related Prof. Gadgils view points on rituals and superstitions and myths as essential to the maintaining of sacred forests and knowledge systems through footage from his older films that included exampled of buddhist, hindu and animist rituals. <a href=\"http://pad.ma/Vs6e8x5j/00:13:51.000\">http://pad.ma/Vs6e8x5j/00:13:51.000</a>\n\n\n    Sadanand Menon showcased two films on the dancer Chandralekha. The first was part of a program made for a cultural show on Doordarshan, and the only footage available of it is the versions recorded from television. In an example of how text/image and histories (personal and public) interact, Sadanand's annotations on the Tanabana program take us through an intimate journey with Chandralekha. Moments that would otherwise be missed (a dog passing by, Chandra making rangoli), if we were just watching the film, are re-read by Sadanand to create a shared space where we begin to understand Chandra's philosophy of creativity and the body.\n\n    Ghar Bachao, Ghar Banao Andolan is an organization that has been working on housing rights, particularly against corporate privatization. They took an existing footage in pad.ma \"A Day in the Life of Niranjan Hiranandani\" and re-read it against information that they have been collection for a few years (through the use of RTI as well as investigative journalism). The grandiose vision of Hiranandani's construction business is read against the material conditions of housing for the poor, while his statements of corporate responsibility are read against the corrupt practices prevalent in the real estate industry, for example.  In a playful manner, GBGB fills in certain narrative of images through sharp political satire.  <a href=\"http://pad.ma/Vtowua9j/L2kv9\">http://pad.ma/Vtowua9j/L2kv9</a>\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "Sites visited include houses in the shadow of the new metro, a hundred year-old ice factory, a car-cover karkhana, a derelict cinema, motor repair and reboring shops, a printing press transported from lahore, a famous clock-tower, amongst others.&nbsp; <br /><br />Roshanara road was till about 20 years ago the centre of the industrial city of Delhi, with Transport Nagar, the old Grand Trunk road, Sabzi Mandi, the Beej (seed) Market and related infrastructure all crowded around it. Old residents claim that it was not only Asia's largest engine repair market, but also an upper-class hangout with Palace Cinema and restaurants and other markets flourishing. <br />In a series of court-initiated \"anti-pollution\" drives in 1996 and 2000, Roshanara road's small and large industries were forced out of spaces they had been occupying since partition. As transport technology also changed, the repair industries could not compete effectively with new imported cars, authorised dealers and so on. In effect, the \"motor\" of industrial progress was moved out of the city, or moved past this sector in other ways. <br /><br />Cycle rickshaws have survived this history. Not in a sense that they emerged victorious, but in that despite court orders (there is an ongoing Supreme court case on their licensing, the culmination of a long period of litigation), police brutality and resistance from resident associations, their numbers in the city have grown from about 20,000 in the early 1980's to more than 900,000 today. The vast majority of pullers live on the street, or in \"informal\" situations in front of shuttered shops, in side-lanes, etc. Recently, cycle-rikshaws have found favour with green groups and the eco-lobby, as a \"non-polluting\" form of transport. This discourse largely does not include considerations of where rickshawallas will live, their health and other needs, etc. <br />Our project then entered this historical and regulatory landscape, and offered members of the public: both locals and visitors, a tour of this landscape of lost punjabi confidence, old machines, labour, bodily risk and local histories.<br /><br />We worked with about 25 rickshawallas who lived in and around the Beej market, Roshanara Road, for over two months. Workshops and meeting were held in the Roshanara Garden and other locations in the area. <br /><br style=\"color: orange;\" /><span style=\"color: orange;\">\n\nSee Tour Route and Credits tab for more. \n\n</span>",

        "header": "Ashok and Azeer spent some time thinking about and building the CAMP terrace roof structure, built in late 2009. Some of the designs that were sketched out are further below: a big requirement was some retractability, i.e. the ability to have a shading roof in the day but to have it open/ partially open at night, for things like screenings under the stars. <br />",

Nerdiness is instead the condition of being invested, interested in the varied and murky levels, floors, and false ceilings of the architectural project. <br /><br />For me a lack of nerdiness is rampant- in the non-construction of small and big nerdy projects, in missing architectural nerdy-movements and discourses, absent nerdy journalism, and so on.&nbsp; Meta-discourses of \"the city\" and spatial politics could also benefit from nerdiness I think, firstly as a way to acknowledge the consequences and contingency of *construction* itself. Because construction has a way of creating its own world, in which things lean on each other, money is spent, screws hold on tight, the wind whistles, and new spaces are born. <br /><br />The following is a nerdy description of a small architectural project we did last year, a folding shade-roof at CAMP. The below is with many thanks to my fully nerdy collaborator on the project, Azeer Attari.<br /><br />The roof terrace outside our studio is roughly an 9m X 9m square. A major reason for this roof project was to provide us a shaded daytime work-space, since we were running out of space in our small studio. We wanted do this light-footedly, to not disturb the building's waterproofing or Society, and to be removable if need be (we rent this space). The other big part of the \"brief\" was for the roof to not be permanently blocking the sun and the sky, and to be somehow exciting. The original set of sketches of four possible solutions are below. <br /><br />There are only two primary forms of architecture, Dave Hickey writes, quoting Morris Lapidus: the corral and the souk. These derive from two primal uses: protection or enclosure inside a corral's walls, and business or social transactions conducted under the tents of the souk, open sideways but \"hidden from God\". On our terrace we had also two, somewhat inverted, functions:&nbsp; a) to provide some privacy during our public screenings, in which nudity, blasphemous and \"offensive\" material could easily be found. And b) to provide a shaded area, for people working on computers, having meetings, smoking, etc. These were the basic imagined functions of our proposed roof structure, a structure that would give us some \"breathing room\", a backdrop, as well as a ceiling.&nbsp; <br /><br />In architecture college, I had developed an interest in a family of lightweight structures known as \"tensegrity\" structures. One of the reasons for this interest was that unlike brick and cement structures these could actually be built and tested by ourselves, using fabric and rope or wire. Models would scale-up effectively, and this was a fast and cheap way of erecting shelters and temporary roofs. They were also challenging, and beautiful structures.<br />The basic concept of a tensegrity structure is that there is only tension and compression at play, no bending. That is, all the forces within the structure are resolved such that no element of it has to take bending load, which is the kind of load that any rigid horizontal element such as a beam or a floor slab usually has to take. Since fabric by definition cannot take any bending load (it bends freely) the fabric part of the tensegrity structure bends into a shape where bending forces are eliminated, and only tension remains. The compression is usually taken by struts or rods made of solid material, but these are also ideally not being bent, only being compressed.&nbsp; Some of this can be seen in the sketch below. <br />\n\n<br /><img src=\"images/SPAtent.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n\n\n<br />This&nbsp;above is sketch of a simple tensegrity structure I and some others built in the winter of 1996 on the SPA Delhi planning campus water tank. (The tank is a raised platform only a few feet off the ground). The kinky detail in it was that the central compression \"members\" (such as they are called) were made from tubelights.&nbsp; That is, the gas-filled glass tubes of used tubelights stored nearby. Maybe we were trying to make a point.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The structure was built overnight, to host one part of a year-long student protest at SPA. This was the \"chain hunger strike\" part, which came shortly after the part in which the director declared the institution closed \"sine die\" i.e., indefinitely. (Later it came to be known that the terms of the \"chain hunger strike\" were quite practical: you could go have your breakfast, then sit here till its time for your lunch, at which point someone else would take over. Such pragmatics were deemed necessary, for our strike to be indefinite). Nevertheless, there was a seriousness and energy in the strike itself, whose longer story must be told another day. But suffice it to say here that the pink-roofed magically-floating tent played a certain role in the dramas of that week. <br /><br />The reason why tensegrity roofs haven't taken off worldwide, has partly to do with a problem as old as Archimedes. Or rather his lever, which could move the world if only it found a place outside it to use as a fulcrum. Think of a campsite with many old-style tents.&nbsp; Each tent has a set of \"guy ropes\" which extend far beyond the \"carpet area\" of the tent itself, and are tied to stakes driven into the ground.&nbsp; Now imagine a tent-city, with support-wires criss crossing the sky and ground. Individual property deeds in this city would have to commit to not only floor area and further-building rights but also \"pressure rights\" wherein other people could squeeze, or pull at, your property. You could be charged rent for \"causing tension\" to someone else, with a premium in the monsoons. &nbsp;<br /><br />Cable providers in our neighbourhood (specifically overhead cable-layers for TV and internet services) have to negotiate actual conditions similar to my caricature above. Hanging cable systems are tensile systems. The cable bends so that the tensile forces in the curved cable suffice to pull the cable up. Negotiating the attachment points of cables is a urban-morphological, material, network-architectural and micro-political problem. Through it, one can approach other phenomena such as why several building chowkidars who turn on water pumps are also part-employed by cable companies. Or, why rubber balls with nylon string attached are sometimes found hanging from nearby trees. &nbsp;<br /><br />In contrast, architectural tensile structures commonly seen today are safely contained in larger spaces such as malls and airports, such as <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dgcreativity/2347298829/\">Mumbai's</a>. Many of these are centrally-supported umbrella-tensiles rather than edge-supported spans. In this sense, they are conservative tensile structures. <br /><br />For various reasons related to the above, our attempt at creating a pure tensegrity structure failed. We didnt want central columns in the space, and there were no available external points to attach to. We didnt want to put major point loads onto an agreeable neighbours window grill, for example, lest on a windy day, the neighbour becomes grill-less. Building other attachment points onto nearby buildings was not feasible, or would involve financial transactions that no one knew how to measure. One possibility was to make the structure smaller than the terrace, but for us to maximise the terrace's use, that wasnt ideal either. <br />In the end, we needed a relatively free-standing structure that didnt have central columns to interrupt the screen, and which would also fold away, and be entirely removable. We needed a levitating carpet!<br /><br />The roof that was designed and built is seen below. The key points of the structure are that:<br />a)&nbsp; The weight of the outward-leaning bamboo and steel structure helps to tension the fabric. <br />b)&nbsp; The structure rotates on an axis perpendicular to the tensioning. This means that there is plenty of bending going on, but that the twin-bamboo columns take most of that load. <br />d) The roof is double-hinged, such that it rotates both as the base and top of the column, moving both *away* and *down* when being folded. <br />f)&nbsp; Despite the continuous tension, two people can slide the roof into either of its two states.<br /><br />\n\n<video src=\"resources/camp_roof.ogv\" controls=\"controls\" width=\"500\"></video> <br /> <br />\n\nThese videos and many of the pics were taken in late February 2010. The roof I would say was a qualified success. It didnt suffer from major problems (yes, quite a few minor ones), and has kept the terrace in shade for several months through spring. The terrace felt quite different, and was used more. Before considering what could be better about the roof, lets have a brief look at its materials. <br /><br />The fabric is an agri shade net, and at Rs.5/- a sq. foot is a material cheaper than tarpaulin, cheaper than cotton, and cheaper than a sheet of mineral water 1 cm. deep. The 90% version is able to block out about 80% of sunlight, and is used often for cattle or poultry sheds. One problem, as we found out ultimately, is that the remaining 20% can be felt, in hard sunlight. The net was chosen also because a solid fabric would have had too much wind load, especially while being turned. The roof spans were stitched together using a regular sewing machine, to a full 9 metres by 4.3 metres wide. The edges are reinforced with galvanised steel wire.<br /><br />The roof fabric is screwed onto bamboo beams 4.5 metres long. Bamboo can last 2 years or more, depending on insects and microbe growth. Sharif Shaikh, our nerdy carpenter, had experience with bamboo from his village near Howrah, where bamboo is used for roofing beams. On the further advice of architect and friend Rittick Hazarika, the bamboo ends were strengthened with 6-inch deep wooden plugs, inserted and glued into the hollow ends. This was crucial for the bamboo to keep its shape, and for screwability. The double-bamboo \"columns\" were placed into metal pipe \"feet\" that were part of prefabricated metal bases. The bases provided a rock-solid bottom hinge, and also a big enough weight that the connections to the floor could be quite shallow. <br />As for the \"active\" part: the Maruti hinge gets its name from a car's \"hatchback\" piston. It is the thing that lifts the back \"dicky\" and makes it seem lighter than it is. Each of the four columns in our roof used at 25kg-rated maruti hinge, now a standard hardware accessory in the market, used for lifting shelf doors. The pistons help lift the roof up, and keeps the bar horizontal. These continue to work rather well. <br />When open (in wall mode) the roof bamboo ends slide into 8-inch deep steel pipe cups at knee level. <br /><br />The roof cost about Rs.35,000/- (800 usd) and about two weeks to build, although longer to design. Most of the cost was for the steel hinge details, which have a long life. When the roof is reinstalled after the monsoons, we will change a few things:<br />a) The bottom hinge locking detail was just a set of wooden wedges, which didnt work so well. That meant that we had quite a few cases of the roof opening or closing on its own, in high wind. <br />b) There should be a way to tension the fabric, as it slowly expands over time. This was meant to be there in the original design as a cable and \n<a href=\"http://www.caspiotrade.com/turnbuckle.htm\">turnbuckle </a>at each column, but was never implemented because there wasn't enough scope for\n tensioning in that setup. This is a problem that will have to \nresolved in another way.&nbsp; <br />c) Roof fabric should be protected from one concrete column where it rubs and the fabric was holed. <br />d) Even more starlit screenings will be planned. <br /><br /><br />The roof marked and sheltered a space, whose possibility of being used as a daily work space and occasional public space was explored. Such spaces are rare in our city.&nbsp; The roof became one element of the constellation that is CAMP. Keeping the sun at bay and the neighbouring kids out of <a href=\"http://0xdb.org/0315594\">Girls of Kamare</a> are<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> in the same way</span> a part of the survival of this institution as our cultural values, balance sheets, and emancipatory politics. This is what the roof is \"good for\"; beyond this lies its own autonomy, and between these lies the territory that future versions of the roof could build upon. <br /><br /><br />Ashok Sukumaran<br />July 2010 <br /><br /> <br />\nPhoto credits: Jan Gerber, Shaina Anand, Eric Stein<br />",

Art is the \"profit\" or value that occurs when the sum-total of these outward, dissipative, luxurious forces is greater than the inward-pulling logic of nationalisms, identities, collections, or&nbsp; the self-gravity of artists and institutions. CAMP presents a set of expansions on this statement, via an illustrated history of expansion, dissipation, generosity and waste. <br /><br /><br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: orange;\">6:30 pm, <br />Friday, 21 August 2009</span><br />\nAuditorium, Level 1, Hall 8<br />Pragati Maidan<br />New Delhi<br /></div>",
        "body": "<br />\nThe idea of expenditure is part of culture-at-large, in which art is no\ndifferent from say fireworks or children's toys or weddings or arson.\nExpenditure extracts itself from the cycle of production, to release\nresources, with or without returns, with or without justification, as\nan act of freedom.&nbsp; Expenditure then unleashes a set of forces within a\nspace, with complex and indeterminate effects, enveloping\nparticipants and spectators. Expenditure involves risks, and the\npossibility of entanglements: of being trapped in a death-cycle of the\nlarger and larger gifts of potlatch, of getting caught up in religious\nfervour, of ending in frustrated or willful destruction.<br />\n<br />\nArt has a peculiar capacity to inform the politics of such\nexpenditure, and to understand its\nmanifestations: generosity, waste, and power. <br />\n<br />\nArt is the art of liberating expenditure, by exceeding, ignoring or\nexhausting its ideologies, by threatening its controlled and ritualised\nplaces with new sites of release. By becoming more than ordinary\nexpenditure, by overflowing its social mores. By expending immediately\nand incrementally rather than by accumulating indefinitely. By\nexploiting technological systems to multiply and intensify the acts of\nrelease. Or radically, by spending what one does not have, by\ndistributing what one does not possess.<br />\n<br />\nThe Nine Mores are presented as a set of four pairs and a final (unreturnable) act. <br /><br />(The relation with Bataille is one of debt, shared laughter, but doubts\nabout nihilism. The difference is that our ideas here don't rely on a\nfundamental, metaphysical excess)<br /><br />",

The constant zooming in and zooming out of the camera constitutes a rather peculiar artificiality of the picture: operational by a factor X that multiplies the amount of detailed information at the price of context. This is a regime of visibility that promises to provide access to what would otherwise, and in the true sense of the word, be inaccessible, since one would not be allowed to go there, or know how to understand what is going on.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify; \" /><span style=\"color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); \"></span><br style=\"color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify; \" /><span style=\"color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); \">The results are profane and deconsecrated icons that map lost properties as robbed and removed social relationships.

Going beyond the technical misuse of surveillance technologies, the filming methods open up to new potentials: a house becomes a support for a camera, a sort of tripod built from stones. The petrified position of the camera only allows movements on a fragile surface of the image.

        "header": "Presenting four projects CAMP has been doing this past year, away from home-base in Bombay. The presentations are in sets of two, setting up some relationships between them, and between \"local\" contexts, whether in Gujarat or Palestine. These projects took place in Sharjah, Delhi, Jerusalem, and London.&nbsp; All of them are ongoing, in different ways, and part of our aim here is to show why, and to share our future plans. <br /><br /><span style=\"color: orange;\">Saturday and Sunday, January 30-31, 2010</span><br />6:30 pm. sharp <br />at <a href=\"http://camputer.org/campstudio.html\">CAMP studio. </a><br /><br />",
        "body": "<br />Day ONE, January 30, 2009. 6:30- 9:30 pm. <br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1.&nbsp; Wharfage:</span><br /><br />A book, and a radio event, on a port. <br /><br />Perpendicular to the concept and the reality of Somali \"piracy\" is the back-and-forth movement of oversized wooden ships between the UAE and various ports in Somalia. These ships carry daily goods, dentists chairs, baby clothes, macaroni, cars and a thousand other things, as \"break-bulk\" cargo. On the way back, they are either empty, or they carry charcoal. Somalia is a magnet for such trade despite, and partly due to its internal wars, where competing \"semi-states\" do not impose a conventional customs regime. In this sense, Kismayo, Berbera, Bossaso and Mogadishu are \"free ports\", connecting overland to Kenya and Ethiopia, producing a mirror of the Dubai and Sharjah \"duty-free\", as well as of Free Trade Zones being set up in other countries. Clearly, these operations of Somali ports are crucial to the daily lives of a large number of people living in conflict. The majority of the boats and their crews, we find, come from twin towns in Gujarat: Mandvi Salaya and Jam Salaya, which have been building wooden dhows, and sailing the Arabian sea, for centuries. <br /><br />Invited by the Sharjah biennale, CAMP undertook reasearch that, instead of \"mapping\" this movement in a conventional sense,&nbsp; paid close attention to the peculiar conditions at Sharjah creek. Here Gujarati crews, Iranian shopkeepers, loaders from Dera Ghazi Khan in Sindh and Sikh truckers were talking to each other in a common language: Hindustani. Also here, in the throes of the economic crisis, brisk business was being conducted. Around the same time, the Dubai dhow port announced plans to stop international dhow traffic, citing security fears and also problems with implementing UN sanctions on Iran. <br /><br />The project then evolved in two ways: <br />1. We obtained 15 months of customs records of all traffic and goods going to Somalia and coming back. This data, translated from arabic and organized using a custom-built web application, was printed with essays and other accounts, as a book. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (download book in .pdf format&nbsp; <a href=\"http://camputer.org/resources/wharfage.pdf%20\">http://camputer.org/resources/wharfage.pdf </a>) <br /><br />2. We did four days of FM radio transmissions from the docked MSV Nazre Karam, which brought many of the people working in and around the port (upto 5km) into a rare \"free zone\" of expressivity, music, and reception. <br />&nbsp;<br />Wharfage won the jury award at the Sharjah Biennale 2009.<br />Later this year we have initiated research trips to Salaya, have ongoing conversations with shippies and scholars working on sea trade, and are planning the next phase of the project. This will include a new mulitlingual publication, and a new manifestation, for which preliminary approaches will be discussed. <br /><br />The presentation includes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The port, the people, the states. The \"goods themselves\". The list/database as form.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scenes from the radio event. Radio lessons: from restrictions to \"permissions\", and back.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Images and findings from two recent visits to Jam Salaya. <br /><br />&nbsp; 60 minutes, followed by discussion. <br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2.&nbsp; Motornama Roshanara. </span><br /><br />If you got off the metro at Pulbangash station in early December 2008, you could find a rickshaw-walla who would take you on an hour-long trip through Roshanara Road, and the old Grand Trunk Road, with frequent detours to twelve or so sites of \"motor history\".&nbsp; These places included the metro wall where factories once thrived, a cotton mill in a house, the unused 800-seater Palace cinema, a dhaba outside Delhi flour mills, an ice-factory, a printing press, a clock-tower, still-surviving motor repair shops, and so on. Along the way, if you showed interest, a stop at the rickshaw-wallas \"home\" in one of the lanes of the seed market.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are an estimated 900,000 ricksha-wallas in Delhi, a number that has risen from barely 20,000 in the late 1970's. This curve overlaps another, differently-shaped one, of the growth and decline of the mechanised industries within the city. The 1996 and 2000/2001 \"pollution\" rulings and the 2006 \"sealing\" drive cumulatively ended the Roshanara area's golden period as a central transport hub, industrial and repair centre, and changed the neighbourhood and the confidence of its residents, enormously. The \"motor\" of capital has moved elsewhere. How has the rickshaw-wallas relationship to this environment changed, over the years?<br /><br />The new acceptance of rickshaws by courts, transport planners and environmental advocates as legitimate and \"non-polluting\", does not answer many of the questions by ricksha-wallas about where they can live, work and eat. About 20,000 in the Roshanara area alone come from one district, Gonda in UP.<br /><br />So it is not that the rickshaw has emerged plainly victorious over the displaced chakkis, pahiyas and bearings of modern transport and industry, and it is not that the newer migrants have overcome the enormous gulf between them and the residents (older migrants) of this part of Delhi. But there is a feeling of reduced distance, a sense of mutual fragility and shared futures, that this project tried to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;The project involved 22 rickshaw-pullers,&nbsp; with whom we are planning a phase-two, which may result in a long-term presence in and around Pulbangash. This project was first presented as part of the 48C Public, Art, Ecology festival in Delhi.<br /><br />The presentation includes: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motornama Roshanara, a film on the tour. 50 min. <br />followed by discussion.<br /><br /><br />DAY TWO.&nbsp; January 31, 2009. 6:30- 9:30 pm. <br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. The Edgware Road project</span><br /><br />An archiving and \"printing\" project,&nbsp; based on work in Edgware Road, a predominantly Arab street in London. <br /><br />CAMP\nis involved in a 2-year web-based archiving and \"print-from-web\"\nproject, linked to its own investigation of landscapes of commerce and\npleasure in this part of London. CAMP had a \"main street\" approach here, because we felt that many of the tensions here around\nimmigration, identity and conflict with authorities were related to the\npull of entrepreneurial activities on the road, and the character of\nthe road itself.&nbsp; As part of the first \"block study\", we investigated\nseveral buildings and their ownership and use histories. <br />One story\nthat we present here is a chronology of 51-53 Edgware road, which used\nto be a newsreel theatre, and then the Gala Royal cinema, showing\n\"continental\" films and then adult films. In 1980 it was taken over by\nan Egyptian businessman (at a time when there was very little Arab\npresence) and converted into an Arabic Centre, which included at\nvarious times an Egyptian film club, the first Arabic video shop and\ndistribution label, belly dancing and music in the cinema hall, a\nlibrary, an Arabic newspaper store, a hair salon and an Arabic\nnightclub. The Centre had a brief life, but served as one of the\n\"orientation\" points for incoming Kuwaitis, Saudis, Iraqis and others,\nboth oil-rich and working-class.&nbsp; The story is, loosely speaking, a bit\nas if a Nigerian entrepreneur were to take over one of Mumbai's\ndecrepit single-screen cinemas, and turn it into a commercial centre\nfor \"African Culture\". This obviously leads to a whole range of\nconflicts and contradictions, which in the Edgware Road case, still\nresonate today. <br /><br />The web-based part of the project is\ncollecting information from various such \"studies\", conducted by us and\nothers, which then pass through an editorial committee formed with\npeople from the street, and are published in a number of physical forms.&nbsp;\nThis is an ongoing project, as part of the Serpentine Gallery's Public\nProgram.<br /><br />The presentation includes: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Arabic Centre, 1981- 1989. 30 minutes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Glimpses from the website backend archive, editorial process, software.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Discussion of forms of \"publication\": placemats, tabloid, video screenings. <br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4.

In seven different \"episodes\", residents\nview nearby archeological digs, their own recent homes, the wall, both\nnear and far settlement activity, and other mundane-seeming details of\nthe slow and deliberate occupation of East Jerusalem. Shot with a\nsecurity camera, these videos suggest that before and after\ninstrumental \"surveillance\", there is jest, memory, desire and fear\nthat pervades the project of watching. Especially here. <br />\nOften the images will lead the commentary. At other times, the\nnarrative spills out first, and the live commentator / camera operator\nseeks a nearby image that might speak for it. In this way, through the\nfilm, Palestinian residents evaluate what can be seen, and speak about\nthe nature of their distance from others.<br /><br />The presentation includes:&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A 35-minute film.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notes on the neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem: 20 mins.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Discussion.<br /><br /><br />Invited respondents: Nancy Adajania, Kaushik Bhaumik, Shuddhabrata Sengupta, Nishant Shah.<br /><br /><br /><br />",

        "schedule": "We invite you to <a href=\"http://pad.ma/\" target=\"_blank\">pad.ma</a>'s first major international workshop, a two-week engagement with people, images and archiving practices in Beirut. <br />\n<br /><b>Don't Wait for the Archive</b><br />Archiving practices and futures of the image. <br />A workshop and colloquium with <a href=\"http://pad.ma/\" target=\"_blank\">pad.ma</a><br /><br />To\nnot wait for the archive is often a practical response to the fact that\nthere are missing or absent archives in many parts of the world. And to\nwait for the state archive, or to wait to<i> be archived</i>, is not a healthy option.<br />\n\n<br />Among the many metaphors for archives that trap time, we could count: the\narchive as a promised land that remains forever on the horizon, the\narchive as a crusty or aspirational monument to state heritage, or the\narchive as a fruit which ripens only to attract the market. But there\nare other metaphors too, which bring us to other possibilities. There is for example the very old idea of the archive as a\ngarden, in conflict with the idea of the archive as a forest, or as a\nfarm. Or the archive as a river, for instance, which accepts the\nstructure of the archive to be both directional and temporal, and which\ntakes into account phenomena like floods, sediments, leakage, boatmen,\ndriftwood and even drowning. To enter the archive mid-stream is exactly\nparallel to what the digital does, or is: neither the beginning nor the\nend of the archive, but the <i>in medias res</i> (in the middle of affairs) of contemporary archiving.&nbsp; <br />\n\n<br />This <b>10-day workshop,</b> with a team of artists, videomakers, writers, programmers and legal researchers who work on the <a href=\"http://pad.ma/\" target=\"_blank\">pad.ma</a>\nonline archive project, is designed to share the imaginations,\nanxieties, tools and materials that propel image-based archival\npractices towards their futures. It uses as a basis <a href=\"http://pad.ma/\" target=\"_blank\">pad.ma</a>'s\nexperience in working with video and the internet, but is interested in\nbroader questions around exhibition, distribution, property and\npolitics that face archival practices today. We hope to find something,\nin the density of contemporary experiences in Bombay, Bangalore,\nBerlin, Beirut or on the internet, that can lead us to a shared theory\nof the archive that goes beyond its dominant canons (Benjamin,\nFoucault, Derrida). <br />\n\n<br />The workshop is meant to be a time for production and discussion.\nIt is open to anyone who is interested, in writing about or\ncontributing video material.&nbsp; It will take place from<b> April 12- 22, in Sanayeh, 2 pm to 6 pm every day</b>, followed by evening screenings of \"Archive Cinema\", on alternate days. <br />\n<br />12 April: An extended Introduction to <a href=\"http://pad.ma/\" target=\"_blank\">pad.ma</a>. What we archive, why, and how, our experiences.<br />\n13 April: Internet and digital archives. Emerging questions of archivisation, auto-archiving, networks, labour, law.<br />14 April: Two parallel threads begin: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) production around Beirut materials using <a href=\"http://pad.ma/\" target=\"_blank\">pad.ma</a>, starting with the Cinemayat collection.&nbsp; <br />\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) conceptual stream around archiving and related questions, including but not limited to:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; The future of the image, the past of the exhibition. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Still / moving images.

        "body": "Pad.ma has been running as an online archive of digital video with text annotations, for over two years. During this period, the focus has been on gathering materials, annotating densely, and building an archive. At present, pad.ma has over 400 hours of footage, in over 600 \"events\". Almost all of this is fully transcribed and often mapped to physical locations. Essays have been written over video, and narratives created across different clips in the archive. The focus has been on pulling material into pad.ma. <br /><br />What are ways to start thinking about pulling material out of pad.ma? From the onset, pad.ma has had an API (documented at <a href=\"http://wiki.pad.ma/wiki/API\">http://wiki.pad.ma/wiki/API</a>), a programming interface that allows you to perform searches, seek to exact time-codes in any video, fetch transcript and map data, and display all this however you please. Also Pad.ma's General Public License (PGPL, <a href=\"http://pad.ma/license\">http://pad.ma/license</a>) is designed specifically for the reappearance and reuse of the material in Pad.ma for non-commercial, research and educational use. Through the experience of running the archive, there have been various imaginations of multiple, layered, time-based annotations over video: pedagogical tools for learning and discussion; presentation tools that juxtapose text and video in new ways, essays and other writing formats enabled by rich and context-specific media. <br /><br />At the workshop, we hope to explore some of these imaginations for video on the web, and video's new qualities as a result of online practices.&nbsp;&nbsp; We invite video-makers, writers, coders and other enthusiasts to participate. Taking the term \"application\" in the broadest possible sense, we invite participants to bring video material, texts, software, or ideas, combine them with existing materials and tools in pad.ma, and develop innovative kinds of \"output\", which then echo into the structure of the archive.<br /><br />If youre interested, have a look at the Workshop Outline above, and send us a line at pad.ma@pad.ma, with a short bio and ideas for your participation. <br /><br />\n<table class=\"cf gJ\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"gF gK\">\n<table style=\"width: 8px; height: 44px;\" class=\"cf gJ\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><br /></td></tr></tbody></table></td>\n<td class=\"gH\"><br /></td>\n<td class=\"gH cY8xve\"><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<div id=\":2pn\" class=\"ii\n gt\">\n\n\n\n<div bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" text=\"#000000\">\n<div lang=\"x-western\">Pad.ma (Public Access Digital Media Archive) would like to invite you\nto an open house on 16th July (Friday).<br />\nThis event is organized with Center for Internet and Society and\nAlternative Law Forum. <br />\n<br />\nTime: 6:30 pm<br />\nVenue: 1 Shanthi Road, Shanthi Nagar, Bangalore<br />\n<br />\n<b>From Archive to Application (and back)<br />\n</b>an evening of conversations around archiving practices and\ntechnology. <br />\n<br />\nIntroducing Pad.ma: Namita A.

        "schedule": "<br />After a hands-on introduction to pad.ma and its possibilities and tools, the workshop will break up into streams for content and code. One day 2, these streams come back together.<br /><br />In the content stream, participants could:<br /><br />- bring in their own footage, clips from popular or unpopular cinema, science or lab videos, ads or news, artworks or documentary films, and write on or with them.<br />- bring together shots, scenes or sounds from fiction or non-fiction films, and make a 'movie' or create a 'running commentary' alongside.<br />- write over video critically or creatively: theorise or contextualise footage, collectively author textual narratives or weave fiction and/or poetry with moving images.<br />- create teaching units or illustrated lectures using pad.ma, begin a research project or map a phenomenon through video and text.<br /><br />In the code stream, participants would:<br /><br />- devise new ways in which video and text can speak to each other, and to an online audience.<br />- For developers, this 2-day workshop is an opportunity to experiment with the newest web-video technologies. Concretely, we will cover some background and history of HTML 5 &lt;video&gt;, understand how the pad.ma website works with time-based annotations, server-side seeking of video, etc. and finally work on hacking on applications / prototypes using the pad.ma API (http://wiki.pad.ma/wiki/API).

        "body": "Unlike the explorer whose frontier is \"where no one else has gone\", the wooden-ship-captain who says he goes \"where no one else goes\" also whispers, \"anymore\", hinting that things change with time. In this story, Iraq was a destination fifteen years ago, as Somalia is today. Such horizons for \"free trade\" are produced by certain groups doing, openly, what others have deemed temporarily atleast, unprofitable. This takes skill and a capacity, a \"power and resistance at sea\". <br /><br />At the same time, the orientation of ships and traders towards certain destinations has its \"price\". How to deal with unexpected intimacies? Remember, Sara Ahmed wrote,&nbsp; that the words contingency and contact have the same root (Latin: contigere = to touch). Goats crowd the insides of boats, charcoal catches fire. Ethiopian discotheques, sinkings off Oman, and boardings by the US navy are recorded on Gujarati sailors' cellphones. Even if the goods are all Chinese, one state \"feels\" another. <br /><br />So there is one ship here, which could be described as brutal, bottom-feeding, capitalism as usual. And then there is another one, which has a range of peculiar and persistent properties. It is: made of Malaysian timber, brought home in the monsoons, classified as a \"sailing vessel\",&nbsp; a vigorous offspring of the traditional arab \"dhow\" and gujarati \"vahan\", fed on cheap diesel from Iran and break-bulk cargo re-exported from the Emirates.&nbsp;

        "body": "To not wait for the archive, at least means to do \nsomething. To not wait for the missing archive to be recovered, or the \npromised archive to be unveiled, means to make an inventory of what we \nhave, right now. We do have memory, a vague recollection of how we came \nto collect and share the things we care about. But we also have \nimagination, an idea of the archive as it could have been, and this \nimagination might speak even louder. We also have a sense of where our \ncollective practices of borrowing, stealing, hoarding, indexing, \nremembering, and forgetting, have brought us, a sense of what we can do,\n and cannot do.<br /><br />The archives we've been waiting for, will open \nsoon. And they will be \"open\", as it has been announced, and remain \n\"open\". But open to what, and for what? Will it be the \"open\" in \"open \nfor business\", a grand opening to close a number of deals, or the \"open\"\n in \"open source\", an invitation to read, write and redistribute? Could \nit be the \"open\" in \"open-endedness\", or even the \"open\" in the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_city\">open city</a>\", of an early surrender to the enemy? These are questions for us, as we cannot wait, not any longer, for the archive to open.<br /><br />What\n we can do is bring our tools, and see what they're good for, and what \nhappens if we combine them. And despite our memories of waiting for the \narchive for too long, we can speak from experience.

The proverbial dust of the historical archive, its actual censorious or smiling archivists, the digital archive's protocols, video codec or \"social network\", all of these things crowd the archive, its imagination and reproduction.&nbsp; In other words, the archive's real properties tend to destabilize ideal characteristics we may ascribe to it. And tend to take us into exciting side-streets of constraint and possibility, often beyond the motivations or will of authors, rights holders, and even archivists themselves. <br /><br />Such a sensibility towards properties (not restricted to physical qualities, and extending both the usual sense of property and its ethical sense as \"proper\", or propriety) can perhaps express better the work of the archive in our times, acknowledge its mediating powers, and suggest how its metaphorical and allusive capacities can be made stronger. That is, how the archive may be related to creative and artistic practices, which is one of our main intuitions with Pad.ma. Practices that, in general, are always entangled with the properties of the materials they work with. So that the focus on footage and not finished films in Pad.ma for instance, asks for a recalibration of ethics and politics around film. The discussion that we hope to have then, is about such qualities and powers of contemporary archives: including their stable or emergent properties, their performance and beauty, survival and capacity, and autonomy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why autonomy? Or, autonomy from what? Well partly, from the old and still-valid categories: control by state and corporate interests, historiography of and by the powerful, and from \"subjection\" in general. But also, by declaring that autonomy is a basic, ontological property of the archive and its contents, atleast two (related) claims are being made:<br />1. Materials in the archive are not exhausted by annotations, \"users\", or any uses the material may be subjected to. The irreducibility of materials to narratives means that these are deep reservoirs to which we and others can return, and from which new ideas, experiences and effects can continually be drawn. <br />2. The autonomy of the archive inverts the logic of people as autonomous (as free consumers, choosers, users) and the archive as merely a resource, as something to be used. Such an archive then has a riskier, more open-ended relationship with the future. <br /><br />\"In declaring their autonomy, archives seek to produce norms beyond normativity, and ethical claims beyond the law.\" <a href=\"http://pad.ma/texts/10_Theses_on_the_Archive.html\">[1]</a><br /><br />It is likely that this discussion will take us beyond the metaphor of the archive, to its roots and branches, its fruits and farms, and to the ideas and initiatives that now neighbour it, in a changed landscape.&nbsp;It is clear for example that \"found\" materials are no longer found, like objet trouve, as if lying unattended on the road.&nbsp; Many of the things we care about or can work with, are found in private or protected territory. But also, increasingly, amidst vast oceans of digital \"raw material\", as the Wikileaks example shows us.&nbsp; In such an alien (to ideas of culture, or social traditions) landscape, how can individuals or groups act, what analytical tools or creative infrastructures can be built, even at our smallest, scrappiest, and most experimental levels of \"making history\", as Marx put it in a related context, \"in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span>circumstances not of our own choosing\"?

        "body": "<br />What are films? Are they calculating \ncommercial wrappers applied by financiers to moving images, or purified forms that directors and crew distill from grand ideas and too many\n days of shooting? Surely a bit of both, a bit of both, and much more besides. But among the many, often unacknowledged, things and forces \nthat make up \"the film\", there is one thing that physically, undeniably,\n film is \"made of\". We usually call this material, footage.<br />\n\n\n<br />But of course, film is not just made of footage pieces, or rows of\n images. As if counting all the bricks or admiring the square feet in a home would \ntell us everything about it. Films have their own wholeness, beauty, \naura. Footage on the other hand, is the ghost that flickers from inside\n every film, suggesting the autonomy of the images, threatening to \noverflow their \"use\" in the film.&nbsp; Flickering by at 24 (or 25) times a \nsecond is not \"frames\" (since that would be only a narrow technical \ndefinition), nor \"<a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Godard\">truth</a>\" (since that would be a bit romantic), but \nfootage. Footage is what exists, the moment a camera \"films\", and that \nremains a stubborn kernel at the heart of everything made from it.<br />\n\n\n<br />Louis Malle's 1969 TV film, L' Inde Fant<font size=\"2\">\u00c3\u00b4</font>me,&nbsp;\nprovides a visceral example of this. In 2010 this film (part 7 of it) flickers for us \nbetween one kind of recognition -of the directors voice and intent- and \nanother- of landmarks, people or contexts from Bombay of the late \n1960's- and a third- of the official response to the film. As the \nauthorial narrative waxes and wanes, and as it becomes clear that \nintentions on various sides can expire, the footage remains. In every \nfilm, some footage remains, and we can glean things from it.&nbsp; And every \nfootage is then part of possible, future, films. <br />\n\n\n<br />But there is other footage too, which has nothing to do with films. \nWhich is not born within the idealism, auterism or commercialism of \nfilms. And which is not just a natural produce of so-called \"digital \nnatives\", either. In other words, there are diverse forms, materials and\n effects, to be found in the space between film and video genres, their\n technologies, learned shooting habits and pure chance, that we would \nlike to explore in some detail over these eight weeks, with the help of \nothers who have thought through and produced in this way before. All of \nthis suggests that footage has the capacity to be a vital \"currency\" in \nrelationships, arguments, pleasures and politics both within cinema and \nbeyond it, not limited to the ways that, say, YouTube allows us to deal\n in it. <br />\n\n__________<br /><br />Look forward to seeing you there. <br /><br /><br />",

In digital art archives, such translation is \npresent in many everyday acts of scanning, tagging and uploading. The \ntransformation of analog art works into digital items not only changes \ntheir storage medium and handling qualities, but also makes them enter \ncompletely new relations, exchanges and equations. Digital materials \ntend to multiply and to leak, to both create great wealth and provide \ngreat distraction.&nbsp; \"Digital labour\" or changed work habits is another \nconsequence of this, which in turn changes how we think about the \nproduction and growth of such archives. <br />\n<br />To realise the digital archive's full potential means to take the \nidea of translation quite seriously, as a basic unit for all kinds of \ndistributive and transformative forces, indirect effects, and creative \nmisunderstandings.<br /><br /><br />",

        "body": "<br />On our rooftop, with internet cables overhead, firecrackers \ncelebrating unknown events, amidst a flurry of projects, in a break from\n programming, carpentry, and travel, and interrupting our usual \nscreening schedule, we have the pleasure of announcing an informal \nencounter with the philosopher Graham Harman, and his recent and \nupcoming books, including the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">three that came out in November</span> last year:&nbsp; the fiction work <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Circus Philosophicus</span>, \"Platonic myth meets American noir in this haunting series of \nphilosophical images from gigantic ferris wheels to offshore drilling \nrigs.\", <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Towards Speculative Realism</span>, a collection of his essays on Heidegger, phenomenology and objects since 1997, and  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">L'Objet Quadruple</span> (The Quadruple Object, currently only in French), which lays out his theory of a fourfold split within objects. <br /><br />Graham Harman is one of the most exciting voices in contemporary philosophy. He lives and teaches in Cairo, is a prodiguous <a href=\"http://doctorzamalek2.wordpress.com/\">blogger,</a> and is the author of several books constituting what he describes as an Object-Oriented philosophy.&nbsp; See more here: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Harman\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Harman<br /></a><br />One of his key older works (already from 2009) is a book on Bruno Latour: \"The Prince of Networks\" is available as open-access <a href=\"http://www.re-press.org/book-files/OA_Version_780980544060_Prince_of_Networks.pdf\">here</a> and takes seriously Latour as a philosopher, describing Latour's books Irreductions, Science in Action, We Have Never Been Modern, and Pandora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hope as having major consequences for metaphysics and philosophy. One of these consequences, congruent with Harman's own view,&nbsp; is that human subjectivity can no longer sustain a central position in philosophy, and we need to attend to the ways in which: \"the arena of the world is jam-packed with diverse objects, their forces unleashed and mostly unloved... snowflakes glitter in the light that cruelly annihilates them; damaged submarines rust along the ocean floor. As flour emerges from mills and blocks of limestone are compressed by earthquakes, gigantic mushrooms spread in the Michigan forest. While human philosophers bludgeon each other over the very possibility of \"access\" to the world, sharks bludgeon tuna fish, and icebergs smash into coastlines.\"&nbsp; A provocative aspect of Object-Oriented Ontology is an argument for \"aesthetics as first philosophy\", as well as \"allure as causation\"... in other words, suggesting that a kind of aesthetics is the primordial force which causes everything in the world to happen.",

        "body": "<br />In October 2010, a major conference and exhibition was organised in \nthe port town of Mandvi in Kutch.&nbsp; The exhibition 'Gujarat and the Sea' \nwas, as its curator puts it, \"opportunistic\". It&nbsp; made use of \nopportunities to access UK-based archives, to bring about 80 maps, \nphotographs, and objects, mostly printed as high-quality digital reproductions, to Jainpuri in Mandvi. These materials were sourced\n mainly from the British Library collection, the UK National Maritime \nMuseum, and private collections both in Gujarat and abroad.&nbsp; There is a \nspecific poignancy to the material as it is exhibited: the reproductions\n are carefully printed on archival paper, but only have licensed \npermission to be shown over one three month period.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n<br />A three-day international conference on 'Gujarat and the Sea' also \nopened at the same time in the same Mandvi venue. Unlike the conference \nhowever, the exhibition has since travelled to other parts of Gujarat: to the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad in November, and to the Science Centre in\nSurat in December. For us, this exhibition already constitutes a \nnoteworthy contemporary response to the \"historiography of the Museum and the Archive\"\n of this history, in Gujarat. <br />\n<br />One question it raises directly is, what does it take to be \n\"opportunistic\", in this way? Who can be opportunistic? This question \nhas implications for exhibition practices, and the idea of what \nexhibitions can be. And the question for art perhaps is, how can such \nopportunity, access to faraway image archives in this case, be further \ntranslated or traded, and in which spirit, style, or medium?<br />\n<br />GATS is organised by a well-known Gujarati cultural group, with a \nBritish curator, Kutch-based NGO partner, and financial support from \nlocal government and multinational interests. These assets were \nleveraged, not without internal frictions and differing interests, to \nbring some images \"back\" to within a stone's throw of contemporary \nboatbuilding and seafaring activity on Mandvi's Bandar road. Exhibitions\n are not typically about knowledge, and so it is not a \"knowledge gap\" \nthat separates this exhibition from the ships and seafarers around the \ncorner. It is perhaps a more primal question, of what can be seen, \nheard, felt, or alluded to and in which kind of marriage between form \nand context. In what practical manner can the violence, smuggling, \nbuggery, foreignness, local pride, predominantly Muslim \nseafaring class, and many other known aspects of Gujarat's maritime \nhistory be \"exhibited\", and be received by audiences?<br />\n<br />Some hints are there in the materials themselves. Many maps and \nimages in the GATS exhibition are layered with past annotations, claims,\n borrowings, translations: notes in Gujarati on english pilot's maps, \nenglish scrawls on Gujarati lists, photos taken with or without \n\"permission\", and often an in-built indifference to or obscuring of \nsources. The exhibition freezes such running threads into one \n\"appearance\", lighting up some routes, paths by which this material may \nbe felt or appreciated, while remaining shy of others. <br />\n<br />CAMP is proposing here to continue this route-finding effort, by \nannotating, cropping, layering, and extending \"Gujarat and the Sea\".&nbsp; At\n a certain distance from Gujarat, with the help of historians and \namateurs working in the field, and through our own work on contemporary \nGujarati seafaring activity as far-flung as Somalia and Iraq, we believe\n that many more layers of this story can unfold.&nbsp; This is then the \nexhibition as \"relay\", which in the best case leads to more responses \nfrom other \"parties\", so that exhibitions like these mark a \n\"shubh-aarambh\", a providential beginning, and not an end, of debates \naround their subjects. <br /><br />An online version of the exhibition will be posted here shortly. <br />The Delhi exhibition is open upto January 27, 2011.<br /><br />Design and Production by Samir Parker<br />Thanks to Edward Simpson and Iyesha Geeth Abbas<br /><br /><br /><br /><font color=\"#888888\">\n</font>",

Fifteen years after the end of the Second World War, SS Colonel Adolf Eichmann was captured in Argentina, where he was living and working under a false name, by Mossad agents and taken to Israel for trial. Leo Hurwitz, an American leftist film-maker was hired to record the Eichmann trial, which he did using four concealed cameras. In 1991, when filmmaker Eyal Sivan inquired about the footage, he was told that it didn't exist. In 1999, Sivan and Rony Brauman put together this 128-minute film, disrupting the chronology of the trial and highlighting instead its tone and environment, from over 300 hours of the recorded footage they were able to access (one third of which had decayed by then). <br /><br />2. At the request of the PLO, \"The Dziga Vertov Group\" shot footage of the Palestinian resistance in 1970. They were only able to edit the footage and make the film Ici et Ailleurs (Here and Elsewhere) in 1974, retaining \"only five shots\" from the original material. <br /><br />\"In 1970, this film was called Victory. In 1974, this film is called Here and Elsewhere. And elsewhere.

Pennebaker, 1967, 96 mins) a landmark; as a film and as a \ndocument of rock history. Directed by Pennebaker, one of the \npioneers of direct cinema, the film starts with one of the first-of-its \nkind \"music videos\", and proceeds to document everything from intimate \nlate-night moments to live performances in Dylan's 1965 tour of \nEngland.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n\n<br />2&gt;<b> Eat The Document</b> ( Bob Dylan,1972, 54 mins) : In 1966, \nPennebaker once again accompanied Dylan on his tour of the UK - this \ntime Dylan had 'gone electric', with The Hawks backing him through the \nsecond half of his performance. After this tour, Dylan would not allow \nPennebaker to complete the film. Eventually, Dylan and Howard Alk spent \nsome time editing what became \"Eat the Document\", a widely bootlegged \npiece of video material.<br />\n\n<br />3&gt; <b>No Direction Home</b> ( Martin Scorsese, 2005, 208 mins) :&nbsp;\n This film is a series of interviews with Dylan himself, Joan Baez and \nothers. The film inter-cuts the interviews with pieces of footage taken \nfrom earlier films, piecing together Dylan's life from his arrival in \nNew York City in '61 up until his motorcycle accident in '66.<br />\n\n<br />4&gt;<b> I'm Not There</b> ( Todd Haynes, 2007, 135 mins) : This film\n has six characters enacting different 'ghosts' of Bob Dylan. The movie \ncontains many, sometimes surreal, re-enactments of scenes from archival \nfootage, mostly from the above films.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\"here lies bob dylan<br />murdered<br />from behind<br />by trembling flesh<br />who after being refused by Lazarus,<br />jumped on him<br />for solitude<br />but was amazed to discover<br />that he was already<br />a streetcar &amp;<br />\n\nthat was exactly the end<br />of bob dylan<br /><br />he now lies in Mrs. Actually's<br />beauty parlor<br />God rest his soul<br />&amp; his rudeness<br /><br />two brothers<br />&amp; a naked mama's boy<br />who looks like Jesus Christ<br />\n\ncan now share the remains<br />of his sickness<br />&amp; his phone numbers<br /><br />there is no strength<br />to give away -<br />everybody now<br />can just have it back<br /><br />here lies bob dylan<br />demolished by Vienna politeness-<br />\n\nwhich will now claim to have invented him<br />the cool people can<br />now write Fugues about him<br />&amp; Cupid can now kick over his kerosene lamp<br />boy dylan-killed by a discarded Oedipus<br />who turned<br />around<br />to investigate a ghost<br />\n\n&amp; discovered that<br />the ghost too<br />was more than one person.\"<br /><br />- Bob Dylan, Tarantula, 1965-66<br /><br /><br />",

        "body": "A note in the catalogue, by Florian Schneider:<br /><br />CAMP<br />Al Jaar Qabla al Daar <br />(The Neighbour before the House)<br />\nJerusalem, 2009<br /><br />When the Israeli government demolished the \nMoroccan Quarter in 1967, it was the fifth and smallest of old \nJerusalem's neighbourhoods. Private property was converted into public \nspace: the former Moroccan Quarter is now a large open plaza leading up \nto the Western Wall, in use as an open-air synagogue.<br />\n<br />At first glance, the idea of a neighbourhood appears as the most \nobvious contradiction to the series of displacements, deferrals, \ndistortions and fault lines existing on the surface of this highly \nvolatile, contested and segmented city.&nbsp; <br />\n<br />Neighbours are supposed to know each other. The neighbourhood is \nthat part of the otherwise anonymous cityscape, where one is recognised,\n or where the subject is hailed. Neighbours can encounter each other \nwithout technical mediation; they meet and greet face to face, \neverything is within walking distance.&nbsp; Such a more or less homogenous \nlocal environment is ruled by specific circumstances that are \ncharacterised precisely by the fact that they are not globally valid, \nthat are not exchangeable or even communicable. It is grounded in the \nproduction of a self that claims the right to the given territory: to be\n exactly and exclusively here, often as a result of ownership or \nproperty.<br />\n<br />But this idealised notion of a setting and the staging for the \nproduction of&nbsp; \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceveryday life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the threshold of public and private \nspace, needs to be governed by an archaic rule that prevents the self \nfrom selfishness: watch out for the neighbour and \"love him or her as \nyourself!\" The Golden Rule of ethical reciprocity and fair play \u00e2\u20ac\u201c -doing\n as one would be done by \u00e2\u20ac\u201c treats the neighbour as the \"other\", who then\n becomes universal. The homogenisation of a local environment as a \n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcneighbourhood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 then correlates with the moral purification of a \ncommunity, a people, or humankind.<br />\n<br />What we can see in the video project Al Jaar Qabla al Daar, is a \nneighbourhood in a state of permanent crisis. Spatial proximity does not\n produce any sense of community, but does the opposite. What was private\n space becomes public; what was private life becomes political. <br />\n<br />Al Jaar Qabla Al Daar&nbsp; sets out to reverse engineer&nbsp; the \nneighbourhood as a machine for self-monitoring and surveillance, one \nthat normally turns contingency into consistency and the visible into \nthe sensible.&nbsp; Here the neighbourhood can only be encountered through a \ntechnological device that produces closeness and remoteness, which would\n otherwise remain entirely abstract. The constant zooming in and zooming\n out of the camera constitutes a rather peculiar artificiality of the \npicture: operational by a factor X that multiplies the amount of \ndetailed information at the price of context. This is a regime of \nvisibility that promises to provide access to what would otherwise, and \nin the true sense of the word, be inaccessible, since one would not be \nallowed to go there, or know how to understand what is going on.<br />\n<br />The results are profane and deconsecrated icons that map lost \nproperties as robbed and removed social relationships. And this is \neverything but self-explanatory: one needs a speech that goes against \nthe grain of the all too obvious status quo. A speech that reads out the\n secrets of dispossession and renders every property decipherable as an \nappropriation; that is twisted and oblique, but nevertheless takes place\n in the first person.&nbsp; <br />\n<br />It is the iconic quality of the pictures, their status as \noperational images, that marks the impossibility to make \"a film\" in the\n first place.&nbsp; The neighbourhood is scattered and inaccessible, the \nneighbour is turning out to be&nbsp; a monster. Going beyond the technical \nmisuse of surveillance technologies, the filming methods open up to new \npotentials: a house becomes a support for a camera, a sort of tripod \nbuilt from stones. The petrified position of the camera only allows \nmovements on a fragile surface of the image. It is not possible to \nchange the perspective and switch from one self to another.<br />\n<br />There is an unforeseeable and incalculable quality of the material \nitself: the self-centeredness of the picture does not pretend to include\n or exclude anything or anyone; it can be virtually anywhere. It opens \nup a third realm that is neither subjective nor objective, a space which\n may be characterised by a new, radical form of hospitality that could \nallow us to escape the discourses of property, security and paranoia.<br />\n<br /><br /><br /><br />",

There should be. <br /></font></p>\n<font size=\"3\">\n\n\n<p> Because on the one hand, as the anthropologist Michael Taussig describes it,\nthe modern sea<i> is</i> an image, a wallpaper\nbackdrop for a Malibu or Folkestone lifestyle. On the other hand, in mostly\ninvisible movements, the seas transport more than 90% of all global trade. So from\nany given coastline, the sea is an image, and it is not, too. Images of the sea remind\nus of this situation precisely: that what you can see is always just the surface, the proverbial\ntip of the iceberg. <br /></p>\n\n\n<p>One eye or two? The inorganic, technological eye not only extends, but exacerbates human\nvision (i.e. could also make it worse).<br />In a way, every optical instrument produces a new visual \u00e2\u20ac\u0153medium\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \nlike painting or television. A telescope is a medium. So is radar. So is\n a wink. Such mediations and their effects enter parasitic exchanges  \nwith other mediums like film or photography. For instance in the 18th \nCentury seaside Camera Obscura, before cinema, outside which people would often line \nup and pay good money, just to see an image of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">very same \noutside</span> they just walked in from. This kind of power is not only a technical \nmatter (it is), but also a matter of context: the lines were longest \nwhen there were lovers on the beach.</p>\n<p>For the NCI Folkestone, the usual area of interest is the immediate vicinity of\nCopt Point, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blind spot\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for Dover Coastguard. But binoculars don't have speed limits, or built-in censors.\nIn other words, what can be seen <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">is</span> somehow uncontrollable. It will include banana carriers and gin palaces and local fishermen that one knows. The open sea makes it impossible to\nwatch only protectively, it asks us to watch longingly, embarrassedly and helplessly too. <br /></p>\n\n\n<p>There is a room behind the film that you see here, full of voices, radio, and conversations. As the nature of watching\nshifts, sound does too, and we hear the overlap and struggles for space between different \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sources\u00e2\u20ac\u009d:\ncoastguard radio, AIS, google searches, personal memories, shared\nhumour, BBC radio. <br /><br /></p>\n\n\n<p>In the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big society\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, volunteers will self-organise to do\nwhat the state now does. Education, basic services, and policing. But surely\none of the preconditions of voluntary work is to be able to determine one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own\nsense of what duty is: and in which way one chooses to become part of the images\none

        "body": "<br />Lets bring some things back to the table: media/ mediation, \ntechnology, collaboration... all things between things. Since we realize that mediation is everywhere, and is not just a feature of new media or electronic forms. The sea is a medium for trade and for piracy, an organisation (such as CAMP) is a\n medium for what \"messages\" it can produce, electricity is a medium for not only energy, personal consumption and family life, but also global struggles around raw materials and \ndistribution infrastructure. <br /><br />How to make art that nestles in such a world, and tries to influence it? Our own approach has been to work with the ideologies, \naffordances and breaking points of \"media\" ranging from cycle rickshaws,\n wooden ships, state records, web browsers, basic infrastructures like \nwater and electricity, to institutional environments such as CCTV control \nrooms and archives.&nbsp; The capacities of these mediums are called upon to transmit, evoke or construct a larger, less \ninstrumental world, despite the medium's own tendency towards invisibility. <br /><br />This talk, screening and discussion consists of \nfive proposals to go past the impoverished metaphor of \"networks\", and \nask what a more full-blooded love of technology could look like: for art, \ncollectivity and politics.<br /><br />Discussant: Gunalan Nadarajan<br />",

The first is a film that was shot over last\r\n year on the English Channel that is now re-installed in Kolkata, making a certain claim for its universality. \r\nThe second is a \"not-yet-film\" treatment of the \r\nRadia leaks as a screenplay, with an audio guide as its \r\nsoundtrack. Both these are moments lit up by separate alignments of, broadly, government, \r\ntechnology, and opportunity...<br />",
        "body": "<i><br />\r\nTWO STAGES OF INVENTION</i> <br /><br />In a recent CAMP project in Folkestone on the English Channel,&nbsp;volunteer guards filmed the sea through their telescopes for over a year, in a reinvention of \"duty\", a cultivation of new interests and humour, and an untooling of tools, that could be seen as universal. That is, watchkeepers, timekeepers, guards, guard-machines, fishing and shipping elsewhere are implicated, but so is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Society\">Big Society</a>, and other questions of what happens when the state \"withdraws\".&nbsp; A film made from this footage that was installed at the location it was shot in, is now put online and simultaneously installed in the gallery in Kolkata, thus moving past its own \"horizon\", and starting to act at a distance. <br /><br />Part two is a sketch in response to the question: when data leaks, how to approach this as an aesthetic problem? Which catching positions or hungry gods are invented by leaks, that did or didn't exist before? How to feel a leak, and by what means, especially at the scale at which recent digital leaks have occurred?&nbsp; In the case of the <a href=\"http://powertapes.pad.ma/browse\">Radia tapes</a>, TV-sized sound bytes were enough to make us all engaged voyeurs.&nbsp; But perhaps a more interesting kind of feeling, recognition, or effect, lies somewhere between the allure of individual conversations, and the big dump of information that the leak represents... a level that has to be invented. Suggesting such a level in the exhibition is a screenplay treatment based on the Radia tapes released so far, along with a comprehensive \"audio guide\" as its soundtrack. <br /><br /> If creativity is chain-like, with inspiration, calculation, handover, surrender, and revelatory events \r\nin the world all appearing regularly, then what part of this is to be \r\ndisplayed?&nbsp; No, we don't have to exhibit artistic \"process\" as \r\nincompleteness, waiting, and so on. The proposal here is the opposite one: that \"process\" is best viewed as a concrete set of \r\nstages, each of which offers a certain space for invention. <br /><br /><br />",

        "body": "<br />* Among\n the peculiar ways in which modernism <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">as style</span> developed in the Indian \n\"subcontinent\", two big families of structures are still standing. One could be called PWD (public works department) style, the \naftermath of socialist modernism \nin the Nehru/ Corbusier era, whose \"temples of modernity\" also \ntrickled down into blocks of \nflats, electrical substations, milk booths, neighbourhood water tanks \nand \nother structures that deliberately ignored traditional aesthetics,\n practices and markets, in the attempt to build a new society. The second would be what Ravi \nSundaram\n has called \"pirate modernity\", the non-ideological and often \nnon-legal proliferations that arose to fill in \ngaps in the grid, so to speak, and by which large populations have \naccessed water, energy, films, music, resources and ideas. \nThe \ncurrent situation is of intense commercial and \"global\" pressures on \nthese \nregimes, both of which have a strong aesthetic and egalitarian \ndimension. Contemporary infrastructures (attempts to produce or evoke \nthe equitable, open, accessible, or exciting at a certain scale; similar\n to traditional public spaces, by \ndifferent actors including artists, architects, community groups, \ntechnologists, the state, etc) are looking at the victories and \nlosses \nsustained by \nthese and other standing structures, in attempts to imagine and build new ones. \nYet infrastructures are complex beasts, also capable of great divides between what they look like, and what they do. Hence, aesthetics. *<br /><br /><br /> Ashok Sukumaran is an artist. He has an interest in archaeologies and materialities of technology, and in aesthetics \nbeyond art.<br />Owen Hatherley is a writer and architecture critic. He is the author of Militant Modernism, 2009,&nbsp; A Guide to the New \nRuins of Great Britain, 2010, and Uncommon, about the pop group Pulp, 2011. <br />",

In systems theory,\r\nthis tunnel vision is called operational closure. [1] Which means\r\nthat a system only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sees\u00e2\u20ac\u009d other parts of itself, and is open only to those\r\nexternal events it at least partly anticipates, or can organizationally\r\nprocess. The rest is noise, or blackness, or worse. (We could remind ourselves\r\nthat human-body systems did not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expect\u00e2\u20ac\u009d nuclear radiation, and cannot process mains electricity or crude oil.) </span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial\" lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:\r\n12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:Times\" lang=\"EN-US\">Water flowing into Mumbai\r\nfrom distant reservoirs has no way to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feel\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the people walking on or living\r\nnext to its pipelines. The water distribution system only sees pumping\r\nstations, bends, pressures, and consumers; it hears very faintly, and cannot\r\nrecognize, the protestations coming from neighborhoods and farms that it\r\nbypasses or even, tragically, the rain that falls down all over its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153network.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\nSystems simply translate all external influences into their own internal terms.\r\nSo that dharnas (protests) create only the most insignificant of ripples\r\ninside a water pipe.

How open can an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153open system\u00e2\u20ac\u009d be?\r\n(How much material and energy can really be exchanged with the environment, while\r\nstill maintaining oneself as a system?) Leaks are the exact opposite of a\r\nsystem's ability to translate everything into its own terms. It is when\r\nsomething internal escapes such terms altogether, and can produce unforeseen\r\nrelations and operations, that it is said to leak. If an incoming flood into a\r\nbasement is unassimilable, disastrous, does this mean that the system has\r\nchanged state, or is it a new ecosystem altogether, with marine life and new\r\nelectrical dangers?&nbsp;Leaks, in the willful and ideological sense in which,\r\nsay, Wikileaks operates, or as the metaphorical and astructural phenomenon that\r\nRaqs Media Collective calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seepage,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or as an actual battleground for\r\ninfrastructural control across the physical, chemical, wasteful, or managerial\r\naspects of the supply chains of any city, all perturb a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153systemic\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\nunderstanding of reality.

So their defense, on the one hand, relies on\r\na relationship with existing structures, usually an implied one of critique,\r\nwhich is only the first step in imagining what to build next. On the other\r\nhand, the promises that leaks make are necessarily vague, pointing toward an infinite,\r\nsuspended potentiality. A cloud that fills the sky but never rains . . . is a\r\nfog. More leaks, mean more fog. To say that leaks themselves are a form of\r\nfreedom is too much like saying that information is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out there,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or that clouds\r\nhave enough water for everyone on earth. In this situation, what we may need is\r\nwhat in the Peruvian mountains is called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fog catcher\u00e2\u20ac\u009d: the art and\r\nscience of luring a cloud and making it rain a bit, for you. And ideally, for\r\neveryone else in your village, too. </span><span style=\"font-size:\r\n11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial\" lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:\r\n12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:Times\" lang=\"EN-US\">Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be more concrete.\r\nLeaks are somewhat inevitable, as electricity providers, ship engineers, and\r\nbook publishers have found out. In each case, there have been ways to feed\r\nleaks back into adjoining systems of management and control. Ships have bilge pumps\r\nbut also ballast tanks. Electricity providers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153farm\u00e2\u20ac\u009d leaks by bringing them\r\ninto billing regimes, even if the recipients themselves are illegal and without\r\nidentity papers. Book publishers deploy legal threats while hastily building\r\ntheir own e-book platforms, hoping that some people would rather pay a dollar\r\nthan commit a crime. The water mafia has a keen understanding of, and hunger\r\nfor, leaks. The limits of a critique of structure are clear. In such cybernetic\r\nloops, leaks and structures become indistinguishable. Another approach is\r\nneeded. Our fog-catcher image suggests that it is not only a matter of catching\r\nor releasing leaks. It is also a matter of how to tune into them, using\r\nspecially made antennas and a collective sensibility. Ultimately, to turn them\r\ninto something else\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fog into a hot soup, a TV transmission leaking from\r\nacross the border into a VHS birthday present.&nbsp;[3] This seemingly magical\r\nproject is also one of art: of small humans trying to seduce and transform\r\nsomething large, unformatted, and unruly. </span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial\" lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:\r\n12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:Times\" lang=\"EN-US\">This cannot be done with\r\none's \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bare hands.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Digital leaks, for example, tend to produce a volume of\r\nmaterial that cannot be understood easily. One is awash in it, and yet unable\r\nto grasp anything. The situation suggests new aesthetic categories and new\r\ncraft.&nbsp;It need not mean that search replaces thinking or that all data has to\r\nbe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153visualized\u00e2\u20ac\u009d but that new modes engage in new struggles. The project of\r\napprehending leaks will recognize that this feeling may not be produced in a\r\ndirect way. It may involve machines, collaborations, and durations.

We remember these events through the Shared Footage Group's (SFG) carefully shot, indexed and annotated video documentation, that is now being put online in stages. <br /><br />The evening's progamme includes an in-depth look into the new Pad.ma, both in form and content, and the screening of a short film compiled by Faiza Khan from the SFG material - reflecting on the turn of events in one basti in Ahmedabad.<br /><br />About SFG: The Shared Footage Group was a collective formed in the aftermath of the carnage in Gujarat in 2002. It consisted of&nbsp; film professionals, film students and many other volunteers. The idea was to document survivors' stories on video so that the footage could later be used free of cost by anyone interested in the material. SFG collected about 250 hours of footage that is now being put online in collaboration with Pad.ma <br /><br />About Pad.ma: <br />Pad.ma - short for Public Access Digital Media Archive - is an online archive of densely text-annotated video material, primarily footage and not finished films. We see <span class=\"st\"></span>Pad.ma as a way of opening up a set of images, intentions and effects present in video footage, that conventions of video-making, editing and spectatorship have tended to suppress. This expanded treatment then points to other, political potentials for such material, beyond the finite documentary film or the online video clip.<br />",

        "body": "Afghan Films, the national film institute of Afghanistan, opened in 1968. It is responsible for commissioning and producing the vast majority of films made in Afghanistan till today. In March/April 2012, we held a workshop there that engaged with the Afghan Films archive, the peculiar forms of history present in it, and its possible futures. The emphasis was not only on physical preservation of films, but on asking what kinds of memory lives in these images, and in the people working with them for the past few decades.<br /><br />The negatives archive of Afghan Films is intact, protected and preserved by a long-term staff who also produced and screened these films, through the vagaries of political upheaval. The positives archive is less intact, but more accessible. It is marked by gaps, most famously the missing reels burned by the Taliban in the 1990s. Surviving films show the signs of extensive use, the scratches and splices that come from a film print being run through one projector after another, again and again. To watch these reels is to see an often violently changing ideological landscape set against the continuous effort and precariousness of making films under such conditions. But these images traveling now from film to pixels also showed us rich, surprising and joyful things, everyday moments and festivals and feasts, all the forgotten textures of times past and places lost or since remade in some other image. Both of these aspects of the archive suggest its potential, if it is able to reach a broader audience. It will need both concrete work and special charms to bring this promise to fruition. Our workshop attempted to build the first steps: to leave behind the idea of the archive as a fortress, to enter more fertile and open territories.<br /><br />It began with a bit of time-travel: Vijay Chavan, a Bombay film technician adept with older Spirit telecine machines, arrived in Kabul. He repaired the 1980's&nbsp; FDL90 telecine machine and editing Steenbeck owned by Afghan Films, and trained four staff members to use and trouble-shoot them. Shortly afterward, a local offline database was set up using an instance of Pad.ma. Pad.ma is a web-based video platform, run by a group of groups, including CAMP in Mumbai, 0x2620 in Berlin and the Alternative Law Forum in Bangalore. Unlike YouTube, Pad.ma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus is on deep annotation and metadata, i.e. both written and automated analysis of video material, which is often footage rather than finished films. The software platform is built around the idea that digitised film can be indexed and enhanced with rich metadata, including time- coded transcriptions, translations and annotations (which can range from historical context, to interviews with cast and crew, to critical essays by film scholars).<br /><br />To introduce these dimensions into the database built during the workshop, the digitising of reels was accompanied by a process of talking to people who are part of the community around Afghan Films. The 90 or so films and reels digitised so far range from the 1920s to the early 1990s, and cut across many genres, including newsreel, documentary shorts, and fiction features. Several of the current Afghan Films staff have worked there since the 1970s and have been part of these films as directors, cameramen, actors or support staff. Our conversations with them, and with former staff and actors, became a rich set of annotations for the digital film material. <br /><br />The workshop ended with an outdoor screening of excerpts from the archive in Shar-e-Naw Park, Kabul. In June, the online database made its public debut both in Kassel and Kabul, and much of this material wasl seen for the first time in decades. The voices of communities around the films, and our own voices as artists, filmmakers and enthusiasts, will hopefully provide an accompanying score.<br /><br /><font color=\"orange\">Archive Practicum took place at Afghan Films in Kabul between March 23 and April 15, 2012 as collaboration between Afghan Films, Goethe Institut, documenta13, Mariam Ghani and Pad.ma. <br /></font><br />Workshop team: Shaina Anand, Vijay Chavan, Faiza Ahmad Khan, Mariam Ghani and Ashok Sukumaran <br /><br /><br /><br />",

People normally 'enclosed' by these networks came into the black box of the control rooms to view, observe and debate this condition, endemic in the UK, where there is one camera for every 6 people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;\"><font face=\"georgia\">Manchester's Open Street Surveillance, with its Pan-Tilt-Zoom cameras and systems wired into the surrounding architecture over a decade ago were subject to demonstrations, scrutiny and inquiry by 36 participants. These hour-long sessions became somewhat like a diagnostic clinic, where symptoms, anxieties and inoculations about 'public health' under surveillance were meditated upon. The therapy sessions seemed to work both ways, for the participants as well as the security officers. The film is a documentation of some moments, from these several hours of curious encounters.&nbsp;<br /><br /></font></div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;\"><font face=\"georgia\"><i>CCTV Social&nbsp;</i>has been exhibited at Cornerhouse Manchester, Nottingham Contemporary, Henie Onstad Kunstsenter Oslo and Space Hamilton Seoul.

It was filmed over a month in September October 2009, with a PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) CCTV camera that the residents installed on their own homes (or in the case of evicted families, on nearby houses), a \"tripod made of stones\".&nbsp; The&nbsp;commentary you can hear is of people speaking over the video live, as they watch and move the camera from inside their homes. Sometimes the voice looks for an image, at other times image provokes voices, or they separate into distant landscapes and innermost thoughts.

A tumultuous few decades of these\r\n struggles form the heart of this book, offering on the one hand, images\r\n and narratives of a pleasure filled Dionysian street-life, and on the \r\nother tales of bureaucratic containment that limit and regulate various \r\nemergences of public life. <br /></font></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\"></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\"><br /></span></p>",

But importantly, this is not a collection put together quantitatively, even as we may argue that the epic scales present in the chosen films carry the weight of histories, and put together chronologically show us a century where individual everyday lives face the annals of terrible power; where the human condition battles with nature and technology, with love and loss, with good and evil.<br />",
        "body": "We chose these films for their primacy, their resilience and their beauty. For the formal expansion of the cinematic into something immersive and extreme. Our agenda is also a selfish one. These are films that we want to see, and as Bombay enjoys cool winter nights, the open-air cinema on CAMP's roof invites us to view together films that don't seem to be well suited for solo sittings, confined in a room, glued to a chair, or worse, a computer screen.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you come, we will keep you hydrated and fed. Please bring cushions and blankets if you like. Do RSVP so we can plan our resources. At the end of each 'mini-series' is a day for discussion.

The\n chains linking these to individual perception or sense organs are long \nand twisted. We can think of images as attempts to short-circuit this \nsituation. Images light up every available surface, fighting an \nindirect, metaphorical battle against the disappearance of actual sites \nof financialisation, valorisation, urbanisation, network \nintensification, and so on. These images rearrange what can be seen, \nfelt or alluded to, and thus in the language of&nbsp;Jacques Ranci\u00c3\u00a8re, \nproduce an overlap between aesthetics and politics. <br /><br />\n<p style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.800000190734863px\">In this talk we develop another side of this overlap, which motivates our own recent work, and is about the non-<span class=\"il\">sensable</span> aspects of images, or certain aspects of aesthetic&nbsp;<i>process.</i>&nbsp;That\n is, things that are not perceptible yet, but there is an \nexperimentation that may burst into perceptibility or form at any time. \nThis means the procedures, backends, tweaking of technological or \norganisational contexts, and other ways in which moving images are \nprepared for, thought of, and then made, cast or thrown. Starting with \nseven different clips of near-darkness in the online video archive \nPad.ma, we describe the (also accidental, tentative) entry of cameras \nand intentions into different kinds of spaces, or worlds. The&nbsp;<i>way</i>&nbsp;or\n manner of entering, in relation to and transforming what is already \nthere, is the key shift or interruption here. We give examples of our \nactivities \"behind the image\" and anticipation of it, that try to catch \nin the plane and rhythm of image-making processes, some of what has \nreceded from the immediate senses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.800000190734863px\"><br /></p>",

It is an opportunity for cinema lovers to take part in the largest open digital archive project on Indian cinema.<br />\nIndiancine.ma was launched a year ago to coincide with the 100 years of Indian cinema. It is a resource intended to not only recollect the heritage of Indian film, but also to reaffirm the promise of cinema as an art form as it enters its second century.<br /><br />\n\n<a href=\"https://indiancine.ma/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">https://indiancine.ma</a>&nbsp;seeks to provide an encyclopedic resource for film scholars and theorists, and serve as an in-depth platform for film students and enthusiasts.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiancine.ma/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">https://indiancine.ma</a>&nbsp;already indexes and makes searchable metadata for 36,384 Indian films. This metadata has been compiled, initially, from Ashish Rajadhyaksha's and Paul Willemen's \"Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema\", and enhanced and made up-to-date with other available sources. As per Indian copyright law, films released more than 60 years ago fall into the public domain, and we have been working hard to source pre-1954 movies, archive them responsibly, and make them available for free.<br />\nEminent film scholars like Ashish Rajadhyaksha, Moinak Biswas, SV Srinivas and others are already working within the archive, enriching it with stills, booklets and posters, academic texts and time-based scene analysis, a unique feature of the platform. But the body of Indian cinema is vast, and the broader goal of collecting data about every Indian film ever made, and keeping this information open to the public, is going to need the help all of you film enthusiasts, cinephiles and scholars in your own right.<br /><br />\nThis 2-day event as an invitation to anyone who is interested in Indian cinema, to explore and learn how to make full use of the resources available on this online platform, as well as entice some of you to contribute your knowledge about Indian cinema back into this public forum. These evenings will familiarise you with the tools and interface, and we can then begin doing some exploratory work together. On the first day, Pune-based film scholar Gayatri Chatterjee will whet our appetites with a scene-wise analysis of PC Barua's 1935&nbsp;<i>Devdas</i>. <br />\nOverall we plan to keep things fairly unstructured, but whether you're a filmmaker, film student, theorist, computer programmer or film enthusiast there will be something for you. If you have a laptop, please bring it. There will be free wifi and food and drinks. The event will be partially outdoors on a terrace so keep yourselves warm. <br />\nWe plan to meet around 5pm on the 15th and 16th, and go on until however long people want to hang out / continue working and exploring. <br /><br />\nCAMP Rooftop studio <br />\nDirections: <br />\n<a href=\"http://camputer.org/campstudio.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">http://camputer.org/<wbr>campstudio.html</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://camputer.org/directions.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">http://camputer.org/<wbr>directions.html</a><br />\n</div>",

Pad.ma proposes that film and video \"production\"\ncan be thought of in an expanded way. For example, by a filmmaker\npublishing video that is not a film, a researcher probing documentary\nimages, a film editor organizing footage using the archive, a writer\ncommenting on one or many video pieces, an artist working online, or\nan institution offering archives for public use. Pad.ma was launched\npublicly in 2008, and is a collaboration between CAMP, Alternative\nLaw Forum and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://0x2620.org/\">0x2620.org</a>.

        "schedule": "<i>Notes for a Non-Capitalist Cinema</i><br /><b>Jesal Kapadia and Brian McCarthy<br />&nbsp;</b><br />In the face of capitalist responses to environmental and economic crisis, in which the notion of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153property\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is often expanded or intensified \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether as territorial enclosure, forced extraction and privatization of natural resources, or the privatization of collective knowledge production in the university \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notions of withdrawal and autonomous escape from the destructive machine of capitalism take on a variety of forms. <br /><br />Kapadia and McCarthy's participation in this project is designed to visualize the ways in which spontaneous collective actions and reconfigured notions of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153property\u00e2\u20ac\u009d can take root in a notion of life itself. A new addition to the Pad.ma archive, their work contributes and annotates footage shot by Kapadia in the northeast Indian region of Sikkim. It focuses on activists from ACT (Affected Citizens of Teesta river) and members of the Lepcha tribe, then linking this footage with other material in Pad.ma by various filmmakers, researchers and artists. The project considers a range of non-capitalist implications and manifestations of the footage and documented actions: the potentiality of land without the spectre of monetization; free knowledge production or Lok Vidya (people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge) that exceeds the territorial enclosure of the private university; and reclamation of the right to be. The possibilities of poetically interrupting the archive and creating new forms of visualizations are endless, yet what remains to be seen is if desires are rearranged and new subjectivities with a will to social justice are born.<br />Keywords: Hunger Strike, Property, Territory, Duration, Non-Capitalist Life, Lok Vidya, Collective Pedagogy, Ordinary Life.<br /><br /><br /><i>The Shobak Tapes </i>(1993-1994)<br /><b>Naeem Mohaiemen<br /></b><br />Twenty years ago, Mohaiemen started work on an oral history of the 1971 war that split Pakistan and created Bangladesh. At that time, the local context of memorializing was deeply polarized, perhaps only superseded 20 years later by the \"Shahbag movement\" of 2013. Back then in 1993, symbolic trials at Ramna Park in Dhaka saw a crowd of thousands assemble, chanting the demand about the accused 1971 war criminals: \"hang them.\" However, the next year, the most symbolic of the alleged war criminals had obtained Bangladeshi citizenship in a Supreme Court case (Bangladesh Vs. Professor Golam Azam and others, 1994, 23 CLC (AD). In the backdrop of this heated environment, Mohaiemen began his project to document stories of 1971 as \"evidence\" for a reckoning. The people he was interviewing exhibited a surprising ennui and cynicism\u00e2\u20ac\u201c both about the contested record of 1971, and the schizophrenic post-independence present. Unable to resolve these contradictions, and continually hamstrung by his own binary ideas about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good war,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Mohaiemen eventually abandoned the entire project, experiencing over the next few years a gradual alienation from the field of historiography in Bangladesh. He began moving to the visual arts as a space that allowed him more incomplete, speculative, and \"grey zone\" conversations about the 1971 war. After a gap of twenty years, he is uploading the 80 hours of interviews, recorded on hi-8, to http://pad.ma, thus beginning a process of making sense of this failed project\u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially the shifts in his own subject position.<br /><br />Keywords: Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, 1947, 1952, 1971, Partition, Independence, Memory, War Crimes, Reconciliation<br /><br /><br /><i>People Act Dance, Make and Annotate\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8</i><br />Crossing the Everyday Life of Video<br /><b>Pad.ma <br /></b><br />There is everyday life. And there is the everyday life of video. A peculiar cousin of the ordinary in general, is the video ordinary: made up of non-square pixels, proliferating handheld cameras, CCTV, citizen journalists, exacting filmmakers, pervasive television, and all the things that are at stake with and through these things.<br /><br />All gestures in video should be measured, or rubbed up against, its own ordinary. Pad.ma is an archive primarily of footage and not films. It tries to catch this ordinary, and some of its qualities and evolution, in the Indian context in particular. It collects materials and works intensively through them to try and make sense of intentions, technologies, accidents and effects. It asks whether a film can be beautiful from the inside as well as the outside. It thus enquires about not only in what is visible, but also about the backend in which machines or souls that propel or cast images and sounds in a particular way. Even though the video ordinary is constantly overflowing and receding from our attention, Pad.ma tries to parse some of it, for threads that may lead us to new paths.<br /><br />This hour-long assembly from Pad.ma, made and presented using the website, tells a story of the evolution of the video everyday; its practices, effects, appearances and affirmations in relation to an everyday life that itself is changing.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><i>The Razia Sessions</i><br /><b>Reena Katz aka Radiodress with: Maricruz Alarc\u00c3\u00b3n, Sharlene Bamboat, Andr\u00c3\u00a9a de Keijzer, Nasrin Himada, Laura Taler, Diana Younes and Alize Zorlutuna<br /></b><br />In the Queering Bollywood section of the Pad.ma archive, there is a short clip from Razia Sultan (1983, dir. Kamal Amrohi, Urdu).&nbsp; The film is based on the life of Razia Sultan (1205\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1240), the only female Sultan of Delhi (1236\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1240). The clip depicts a monologue by one of Razia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many suitors.&nbsp; His plea details a long list of sacrifices for the people and the land.&nbsp; It ends with a petition for Razia to recognize his body, one on which \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6many wounds of sacrifice can be reckoned.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<br /><br />Without responding to the suitor Razia beckons her companion to stand.&nbsp; They kiss, and walk away together, holding hands. <br />&nbsp;<br />For The Razia Sessions, Radiodress asked seven of her bi- and poly-linguist comrades, lovers, friends and kin to teach her the thwarted lovers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 phrase in a language other than English over the internet.&nbsp; Radiodress will do her best to learn the phrase well in the short time they have together.&nbsp; Sometimes, the phrase is untranslatable, other times it is hybridized with English.&nbsp; Often the teachers had to ask their own comrades, lovers, friends and kin to help them with translation.&nbsp; The duets traverse the mistakes together - stumbling, laughing and sharing the gaps each lingual fumble evokes.<br /><br />The Razia Sessions will be recorded live during the Images Festival at TPW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s R&amp;D space, and uploaded to the Pad.ma site along with their transcriptions.<br /><br />Schedule: <br />Thursday-Saturday, April 10-12: 4pm<br />Tuesday-Thursday, April 15-17: 4pm<br />Saturday, April 19: 1:30pm",

        "body": "<img src=\"http://camputer.org/images/xray.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n<br /><br />\n\n<p>As the story goes, villagers in Jaunpur, or women labourers in Bangalore (depending on if you want to believe&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.india-seminar.com/2001/502/502%20tarun%20tejpal.htm\"><span class=\"s1\">Tejpal</span></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http://combatlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Price%20of%20taking%20on%20priviledged%20corrupt.pdf\">Bahal</a>&nbsp;</span>on this) responded to early sting operations by invoking an image of tehelka dot com as an x-ray machine located in Delhi that would expose everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corruption as soon as they came in front of it. This apocryphal story became a kind of intuitive peg for conceptual connections between hidden cameras and transparency in governance and intentions.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But all metaphors have their limits. X-rays don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually tell you if their subject is even alive or not. People (we will see) are being slapped and pinched even while under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153truth serum\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Truth in other words, is extracted or built by a combination of means. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transparency\u00e2\u20ac\u009d produced by early hidden camera recordings relied on&nbsp;elaborate mise-en-scene or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153setting\u00e2\u20ac\u009d: fictional scripts, unreliable narrators, great performances and hungry network audiences. Stings and leaks in India have been largely an audio-visual medium, framing violence and encounter, far from transparently or opaquely, as a new skin of documentary experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This evening we present a long-format (2 hour 30 minutes) artists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rendering of a history of images and sounds produced by stings, leaks and more recent citizen vigilante media, with TV overlays and edit styles removed or undone. We follow an evolution or descent of these forms from energetic origins in new media journalism, via proliferating leaks, into an ordinary in which \u00e2\u20ac\u0153every citizen now becomes an anti-corruption inspector\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, in the words of Aam Aadmi Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Chief Minister of Delhi, at the start of this year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There is a difference between ideology and the way things actually look. (It can look worse too). Direction, framing, timing, empathy or lack of it, and again mise-en-scene, count in the difference. Video in this form <i>is</i> a crafted relation between selves and others, a test of ethics far beyond the law, and a precedent for what distributed technologies can do. V<span class=\"s1\">ideo's own protocols are far from settled, and it cruises the edges of \"the networks\".&nbsp;</span>There are a lot of questions here about what a democracy or community of images might look like. For while the selfie says radically, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I represent myself\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, the easier wrist position, or higher Mp camera, still points outward.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">(Part of this material was presented recently as a two-hour video lecture at the 3rd Berlin Documentary Forum, HKW, Berlin.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Acknowledgements</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In Delhi:&nbsp;<br />Tehelka,&nbsp;Cobrapost,&nbsp;Gulail,&nbsp;AAP <br />Aniruddha Bahal, Satyashree Gandham, Shaunak Sen, Aastha Chauhan, Ankit Lal, Vinay Shukla&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At CAMP and Bombay: <br />Zinnia Ambapardiwala, Prerna Bishnoi, Omkar Khandekar, Ashwin Nag, Geeta Sheshu</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At Pad.ma:<br />Lawrence Liang, Jan Gerber&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><br /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><br /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><br /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><br /></p>",

Through and with them, rather than for and of them. In other words, it has been our belief that these are&nbsp;locations from which a new sensorium can be produced, and solidarities remade.<i>&nbsp;</i>Here&nbsp;is where artistic assemblies should nest, and provoke. The studio is a kind of \"internal extension\" of such ideas.&nbsp;Ideas and objects that travel backwards from journeys, collaborations and various leaps of faith, and sometimes stick to the insides of a holding chamber, the studio. Where something else happens to them. They become part of a social space. They gather as selections, bodies, cuts, scripts, new raw materials from the incredible range of what could be thought of as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153culture\u00e2\u20ac\u009d today.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over the years our studio has been a semi-public space that hosts events, projects and people beyond ourselves. Our desire is very much to refresh this invitation; to use these particular/ peculiar resources and spaces in the city.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>The evening will begin at 6:30 pm on Monday, October 6th</b>, and will include:&nbsp;<br />A short survey of conceptual, technical, sensual and political orientations of what has been happening at CAMP.

While that platform promises to be a valuable research and teaching aid it has also generated debates about methodologies as well as the intellectual content of the discipline of film studies.&nbsp;</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>The first of this two-day event shall focus on historical questions pertaining to periods, genres, regions, institutions and inter- media relationships. &nbsp;The second day will begin with reflections on contemporary practice and then shift to the idea and practice of digital archiving, bringing on board questions such as conceptualizing regional cinemas or reconstructing filmographies against the new digital horizon. Practitioners and researchers who have worked on the <a href=\"http://indiancine.ma\">http://indiancine.ma</a> &nbsp;platform shall critically reflect on their experience, followed by Cinemathon, a hands-on workshop to acquaint scholars and students with the processes of digital annotation.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Subhajit Chatterjee</div>\n<div>Moinak Biswas</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Seminar Coordinators</div>",

Later, several top journalists would claim that they were just \"stringing her along\", and their conversations were not based on and had no impact on reality. A broad spectrum of rhetorical agents: &nbsp;lies, cries, &nbsp;pen drives, &nbsp;family feuds and bad networks can thus be heard pulsing through the nervous systems of Indian democracy. The original recordings were made by the government. The screenplay slows them down and asks: what kinds of environments and scenes may lie behind them? The film asks: if debate around these tapes is about whether they are edited or not, or as Justice Mukhopadhay put it if \"splice has been added\", then what could further editing do?</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>",

In a sculptural work, video is seen as a physical force disturbing and seducing subjects. Next to this, a collaboration unfolds in a large mall, in which security people, members of the public and 208 cameras are participants. A third work jujitsus television sets, CCTV and neighbours to reconfigure space, speech and hierarchy in a Delhi neighbourhood.</div></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>These are formative works by members of CAMP. <i><b>Windscreen</b> </i>is from 2002, and has never been recreated. It renders video as a physical force, as well as lure and trap. <b><i>Capital Circus</i></b> consists of actions followed by 208 CCTV cameras inside the largest mall in Europe, in the city centre of Manchester in 2008. This reworking of the roles of camera operators, publics and CCTV itself yields recordings which are here edited into a film, exhibited recently at the MoMA, Anthology Film Archives and Flaherty Seminar New York, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo. <b><i>Khirkeeyaan</i></b> took place in the Khirkee neighbourhood of Delhi in 2006, during a residency at Khoj. It involved near and far neighbours talking to each other over household, shop and factory-basement television sets. <b><i>Khirkeeyaan</i></b> was part of a historical survey of artists interventions into broadcasting at the AV Festival in 2008 and has been shown at the Power Plant Toronto, Frankfurt Kunstverein, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen Dusseldorf, Henie Onstad Kunstsenter Oslo, Cornerhouse Manchester, Hatton Gallery Newcastle, Sarai Delhi etc, and was recently part of <i>Tales from the Networked Neighbourhood: The Cinema of CAMP</i> with Filmmaker Festival, Milan.</div>\n<div>\n<div><br /></div></div>",

An evening without Adachi, for certain: the 75-year old filmmaker cannot leave Japan, since he has spent years in jail for passport violations in connection with a series of airplane hijackings in the 1970s. Also an evening without most of his images: they were destroyed in Beirut in 1982. Adachi knows that he could have made more films, but as a heavy drinker, he also knows that it might have cost him his life. In 1971, Nagisa Oshima, Koji Wakamatsu, Yoshida Kiju and Masao Adachi, on their way back from the Cannes Film Festival, decide to make a stopover in Palestine. They get to Beirut, and Adachi will stay there for 27 years, as part of the Japanese Red Army faction of the PLFP, in hiding, in jail - the one-man film-making wing of the armed struggle, and the one man who meant it literally when he said: Guerrilla Cinema.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Cinema without Adachi, mostly, until in 2011 Eric Baudelaire and Philippe Grandrieux make two astonishing and entirely unexpected films, not about, but rather with and through Adachi. Baudelaire strikes a pact: Adachi cannot return to Beirut, so he will lend him his eyes, trace the skyline and coast, account for images lost, shots never taken and stories left untold. What Adachi says about \"AKA Serial Killer\" -- in order to make a political documentary, no script is needed, just a camera to film the urban landscape, its transformation, the concrete shape of political power -- applies to Baudelaire's film as well. Beirut won't let him down: decades of struggle peel off the shelled-out buildings, entire continents of unseen cinema glisten in the sun by the Corniche, and Adachi's letters provide the distance in time and space across which the images do what images do best: set forth a motion, travel.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Grandrieux -- infamous for his features \"Sombre\" (1998) and \"La vie nouvelle\" (2002), a cinema of dark intensity often mistaken for just another color within the 1990s French New Wave of extreme sex and violence -- in 2011 announces that he is going to make a series of political documentaries. His first one is a journey to Tokyo where he meets Adachi. Grandrieux won't stray far from his style: keep the camera on somebody's neck until your heart beats faster, point it at a tree in a light that will make your breath stop. Where Baudelaire's film stays half-wide, Grandrieux gets close, a series of bodies in the city, nightly highway rides and voices from the back seat. Adachi keeps narrating as he keeps walking and drinking, and when the film reaches its end, what opens up is an entire alternative future of political documentary: one in which the image is no longer an easily transportable form of truth, but a force that returns to and re-emerges from the material world of sensations.</div>",

Their six-year project on the Western Indian Ocean and around the Arabian/Persian Gulf includes the national premiere of their much-traveled film, 'From Gulf to Gulf to Gulf', in which Kutchi sailors and others take us from Kutch in western India to the ports of the Gulf and on to parts of Somalia and the Gulf of Aden, in a series of journeys at sea.

How has the virtual itself evolved, and is it still useful as a concept?

We have systematically rebuilt relationships between subjects, authors and technology in video; between the eye, the lens and the audience; between footage, edits and finished work and pushed film form in ways that do not take these many component parts of film for granted.

        "body": "The session is part of a two-day programme of screenings, presentations \nand discussions on the ideas surrounding experimentation with film \nlanguage and form, at the MAMI Mumbai Film Festival put together by \nAvijit Mukul Kishore and Rohan Shivkumar. <br /><br />SCHEDULE:<br /><br />DAY 1<br />OCTOBER 30<br /><br />Session 1: 10:00 am<br />FILM AS ART: AN INTRODUCTION<br />Lecture and screening session presented by Shai Heredia<br /><br />The first level of connection with the film medium is immediate and sensory. Through a process of viewing and discussion this session will explore the aesthetics of avant-garde/ experimental films, both Indian and international. By forging intricate connections with other art forms, particularly painting, poetry, photography and music, the medium will be deconstructed to recognize layers of form and content.<br /><br />This session will be presented by Shai Heredia, film maker and the founding director of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcExperimenta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an artist-run platform that encourages experimentation with the moving-image in India.<br /><br />Session 2: 2:00 pm<br />IMAGE AS MUSIC<br />\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDhrupad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by Mani Kaul, Films Division India<br />Hindi with EST, Colour, 1983, 70 min<br /><br />Dhrupad is the oldest surviving form of Hindustani Classical music and the Dagars, who have been singing for twenty generations, are responsible more than any one else for keeping it alive. Times have changed but the Dagars have tenaciously strived to maintain the pristine art form. This film is a slow meditative journey that fuses the depth and quiet of the traditional with the hurly-burly of the modern. The conflict between the soulfulness of the gurukul as envisaged and practiced by the Dagars and the philistinism of city life is more left to the imagination than spelt out here. The film's mood ranges from the occasionally playful to the largely pure and profound.<br /><br />Session 3: 4:00 pm<br />PROPAGANDA / ANTI-PROPAGANDA<br />The documentary films of S.N.S. Sastry, Films Division India<br /><br />Films Division, Government of India, is the second largest state-run documentary-producing organisation in the world, the largest ones being its equivalent in the former Soviet Union. It was formed in 1948, with the mandate of recording the visual history of the newly formed nation, using the medium of documentary film. The language and form of these films makes an interesting study, as do the distinct departures from the established norms of documentary film making within them. These departures are almost always expressed through formal innovation; irony and humour, creating films that could be disturbing and delightful at the same time.<br /><br />This session features and analyses the landmark short films of SNS Sastry, one of Films Division\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most illustrious film makers. The films are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAnd I Make Short Films\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (1968), \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcKeep Going / Lage Raho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (1971), \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis Bit of That India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (1972), \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOur Indira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (1974) and 'Amir Khan' (1970).<br /><br />Session 4: 7:30 pm<br />NARRATIVE GAMES<br />\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcUrf Professor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by Pankaj Advani<br />Hindi with EST, Colour, 2001, 120 min<br /><br />Chaos follows after a hit-man's car and winning lottery ticket go missing. Hudda is a Mumbai-based gangster who undertakes to kill people with the help of a man simply known as the Professor, who is in the habit of buying lottery tickets. Both the Professor and Hudda will find their lives changing when the nephew of a gangster gets killed, and they must find an undertaker who is able to put his mutilated face together. This is a dark comedy that keeps playing with the viewers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of the plot and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s characters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 behaviour.<br /><br />The film will be presented by film maker Kamal Swaroop.<br /><br /><br />DAY 2<br />OCTOBER 31<br /><br />Session 1: 10:00 am<br />THE INDIAN NEW WAVE AND IT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S LEGACY<br />Lecture and screening session presented by Ashish Rajadhyaksha<br /><br />It is often said that what distinguishes the independent sector of the New Cinemas from the better known middle-cinema is its experimentation with the celluloid form. The experiments were with lensing, with lighting, with sound, with film stock and lab processing, as much as they were with acting and scripting. While the best known of the celluloid experiments were those of Mani Kaul, they also included films by Kumar Shahani, Avtar Kaul, Satyadev Dubey, Mrinal Sen and Girish Kasaravalli.<br /><br />This presentation is a walkthrough of the formal experiments of the new cinemas of the 1970s. Presented by film scholar Ashish Rajadhyaksha, author of 'Indian Cinema in the Time of Celluloid: From Bollywood to the Emergency' (2009) and co-editor of the 'Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema' (1999-2001). Ashish has recently edited and introduced the writings of Kumar Shahani, titled 'The Shock of Desire and Other Essays' (2015).<br /><br />SCREENING: 11:45 am<br />\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAadmi Ki Aurat aur Anya Kahaniyan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by Amit Dutta<br />Hindi with EST, Colour, 78 min, 2009<br /><br />Amit Dutta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aadmi ki Aurat aur Anya Kahaniyan\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is a film based on stories by Vinod Kumar Shukla and Sadat Hasan Manto. The film attempts to explore the relationship between forms of storytelling in literature and in cinema.<br /><br />There are three stories presented in the film- \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPed Par Kamra (Room on a tree), \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAadmi Ki Aurat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Woman) and Sau Kendal ka Bulb (100 watt Bulb) each a tale concerning paranoia, displacement and alienation, a probing into the complex nature of relationship between a man and a woman, and of the internal world of lonely men in relation to their environment.<br /><br />Amit Dutta, a graduate of FTII specialized in direction is known for his distinctive style of filmmaking rooted in Indian aesthetic theories and personal symbolism resulting in images that are visually rich and acoustically stimulating.<br /><br />Session 2: 2:00 pm<br />THE EXPANDED FIELD OF CINEMA<br />Cinema At the time of More cameras than People<br /><br />Culture theorist Nancy Adajania will be in discussion with with Shaina Anand and Ashok Sukumaran of CAMP, an art collective that has many full forms for the acronym including 'Cinema At the time of More cameras than People'. This session looks at the unique ways in which film and moving image practice move beyond the boundaries of the cinema theatre into the art gallery, the internet and other public spaces; how people work with found footage and videos that may comprise sting material. For over a decade, CAMP's work has rebuilt relationships between subjects, authors and technology in video; between the eye, the lens and the audience; between footage, edits and finished works.<br /><br />Session 3: 4:00 pm<br />OF MEMORY: COPIES WITHOUT AN ORIGINAL<br />\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Forbidden Room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by Guy Maddin<br />English, Colour, 130 min, 2015<br /><br />A submarine crew, a feared pack of forest bandits, a famous surgeon, and a battalion of child soldiers all get more than they bargained for as they wind their way toward progressive ideas on life and love.<br /><br />Guy Maddin is an installation artist, screenwriter, cinematographer and filmmaker who has made ten feature-length movies and innumerable shorts. He has also mounted across the USA, UK, France, Germany, Australia, Peru, Mexico and Argentina numerous live performance versions of his films featuring live music, sound effects, singing and narration.<br /><br />Session 4: 6:30 pm<br />THE IDEA OF A QUEER AESTHETIC<br />Panel discussion<br /><br />While this is a subject of tremendous discourse internationally, discussions on the idea of a queer aesthetic are fairly nacsent in the Indian context. We are yet to start a serious study of queer art from the perspective of form, aesthetics and the politics inherent to the subject. Is queer art inherently related and limited to sexual orientation? And is there a difference between queer and camp? This panel discussion brings together a visual artist, a theatre-person and an ethno-musicologist - all of whom work on film, to discuss what queer art means to them.<br /><br />Panelists: Natasha Mendonsa (visual artist), Vikram Phukan (theatre-person an writer) and Jeff Roy (ethno-musicologist). Moderator: Avijit Mukul Kishore<br /><br />Screening: 7:30 pm<br />\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBlue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by Derek Jarman<br />English, Colour, 80 min, 1993<br /><br />Against a plain, unchanging blue screen, a densely interwoven soundtrack of voices, sound effects and music attempt to convey a portrait of Derek Jarman's experiences with AIDS, both literally and allegorically, together with an exploration of the meanings associated with the colour blue. 'Blue' is the twelfth and final feature film by director Derek Jarman, released four months before his death from AIDS-related complications. Such complications had already rendered him partially blind at the time of the film's release. The film was his last testament as a film-maker, and consists of a single shot of saturated blue colour filling the screen, as background to a soundtrack where Jarman's and some of his favourite actors' narration describes his life and vision.<br /><br />This is the first screening of 'Blue' in India.<br /><br />This programme is curated by Avijit Mukul Kishore and Rohan Shivkumar. Avijit is a film maker and cinematographer whose work includes documentary and feature films, visual art, teaching and curating. Rohan Shivkumar is an architect and urban studies scholar, Deputy Director of Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute of Architecture, who has worked on film-based research projects, curation and is the co-editor of the book 'Project Cinema City'.<br /><br />",

The dialogue is entirely from phone taps made by the government. The screenplay slows them down and asks: what kinds of environments and scenes may lie behind them, and how are they connected?<br /><br />Act II (Hum Logos) is a 45-minute audio film following on from where the screenplay ends, taking us into the next two months, with the new cabinet in power. The film asks: if debate around these tapes was about whether they are edited or not, or as Justice Mukhopadhay put it, \"splice has been added\", then what can further editing do?<br /><br />",

        "body": "<div>The philosopher Alain Badiou in his recent volume on cinema calls it the most impure art form; the place where impossible movements within and across the arts can happen. And in whose short life, no more than a century and quarter old, we have felt as an audience the double effects of anonymous escapes into the dark room, as well as unforgettable shared experiences.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div><i>The New Medium</i> will scour cinema\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s living history and take us through space and time to experience first-hand some of its more inventive moments, as a medium of expression and exchange. Where better to begin, than the audacious <b><i>Man with the Movie Camera</i></b>, (1929). \"This experimental work aims at creating a truly international language of cinema based on its actual separation from the language of theatre and literature\", says the opening title of <b>Dziga Vertovs</b> Kino Eye&nbsp;classic. We bring it to you fresh as ever, newly restored and accompanied with live music from Ukraine by the <b>Vitaliy Tkachuk Quartet</b>.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>There is a meta-narrative in the fantastical <i><b>Kalpana</b></i> (Imagination, 1948), made for a newly formed post-colonial nation anticipating a cultural renaissance. Adapting classical dance for the cinema, <b>Uday Shankar </b>creates a parable in the form of a proposal - to make a film about his vision for patronage, pedagogy and creative experimentation in the arts. Now legally out of copyright and belonging in the public domain, <b><i>Kalpana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s </i></b>quest for freedom and generous patronage continue to date, and we do our bit by presenting it in fully restored splendour.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Preceding the music video genre by twenty years, and formally influencing the<i> Third Cinema </i>Movement, Santiago Alvarez\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s<b><i> Now!</i></b> (1965), made mostly with still photographs, is a visceral and haunting document of racism and police brutality in the United States, its call to action more relevant now! than ever before. <i>Third Cinema</i> was also an influence on French cineastes; and when Chris Marker formed <b>SLON (</b>Society for the Launching of New Oeuvres) and brought together cinema greats<b> Joris Ivens, William Klein, Claude Lelouch, Agn\u00c3\u00a8s Varda, Alain Resnais and Jean-Luc Godard</b> to collectively author <b><i>Far from Vietnam</i></b> (1967), they affirmed \"by the exercise of their craft, their solidarity with the Vietnamese people in struggle against aggression\". We present the restored version of this important political film.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>In 1969 the Catalan filmmaker <b>Pere Portabela </b>becomes himself a parasite on the shooting of the Technicolour Count Dracula starring Christopher Lee, and films a silent, behind-the-scenes film in contrasty black and white. <b><i>Vampir Cuadecuc </i></b>(1970), a relatively unknown cult work is now restored, and presents at once a psychological immersion on the making of films, and an allegorical spin on the dictatorship of Franco. <b><i>Space is the Place </i></b>(1974) starring the jazz legend<b> Sun Ra and his Intergalactic Arkestra</b> is an Afro-Futurist Blaxploitation Science Fiction containing interplanetary travels, biting social commentary, and literally out of this world concert performances. Circulating for years on VHS bootlegs, it was digitally re-released to commemorate the film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 40th anniversary in 2014.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div><b>Lis Rhodes</b> set up the feminist distribution and filmmaking collective<i> Circles </i>around the same time she made <b><i>Light Music </i></b>(1975), a work of expanded cinema where the images she draws on the optical soundtrack become the visuals of the film. She was intervening with her film form into the world of male-dominated music composers. Viewers become performers in this classic 16 mm dual projection of light, sound and fog.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Two films set in Brahmin-dominated villages and filmed around the same time, approach the medium in startlingly unique ways and become urgent cogitations on caste. In <b><i>Chhatrabhang</i></b> (The Divine Plan -1975), <b>Nina Shivdasani Rovshen </b>reenacts the scenario leading up to a real-life incident in rural Maharashtra over the use of a village well by neo-buddhists, but films it with people of Jogia in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, mixing in documentary, voice-over and the poetry of a mill worker. <b>John Abraham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s </b>second feature <i><b>Agraharathil Kazuthai</b></i> (Donkey in a Brahmin Village- 1976) takes on caste and bigotry by turning an anthropological gaze onto Brahmin rituals into a surrealistic and tragic-comic fable that features the donkey as the lead character.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>The Russian novel has influenced greatly, two of the most avant-garde auteurs from our side of the world. <b>Mani Kaul </b>adapts Dostoevskys <i>Idiot </i>into a mini-series and an experiment for television starring Shahrukh Khan and over 50 other actors. We bring you the four-part <b><i>Ahamaq</i></b> (1992) as a single four-hour feature. The now prolific <b>Lav Diaz</b>, master of long takes and protracted cinema and winner of the Golden Leopard, Silver Bear and Golden Lion for the three features he has made in the past two years, took ten years to make his first feature, <b><i>Evolution of a Filipino Family</i></b> (2004), which begins on 16mm and ends in miniDV, runs for close to eleven hours and is set in a rural village that is living out Marcos ten year-long imposition of martial law. Watch it in one go if you can, it will leave you changed.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Three works from 2014 cap the contemporary shore of<i> The New Medium </i>programme. <b>Phillip Warnell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s</b> <b><i>Ming of Harlem: Twenty One Storeys in the Air</i></b> turns wildlife photography on its head as we experience the life of a tiger and an alligator living in a NY apartment. <b>Jean-Luc Godard</b> brings us a 3-D subterfuge with his <b>Goodbye to Language</b>, pulling our eyes in different directions, experimenting with DIY 3-D rigs, Go-Pro home videos and 3-d graphics. And finally <b>Harun Farocki,</b> who passed away soon after making <i><b>Parallel I-IV,</b></i> leaves us with a new history of the computer-generated image in gaming; coming full circle from the celebration of <b>Vertovs </b>all-seeing machine eye.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>We dedicate this edition of <i>The New Medium </i>to<b> Harun Farocki</b>.&nbsp;</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>- <b>Shaina Anand.&nbsp;</b></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div><br /></div>",

People who go shopping and then they decide that they needed to pray...and she was saying this is of all faiths, not just people who had to but people who felt like it...they\\'d find them in corners, praying, and she said it was like a fire risk...it was an obstruction. So they built a special room to get them...it wasn\\'t that they wanted to give them somewhere to pray, its that they didn\\'t want them to pray here. And interestingly, it is right next to that corridor which is the only place in here that has a \\'blind spot\\' right in front of the prayer room. I mean you can see the door to the prayer room, but just, maybe, six to seven meters into the Arndale, there are two static cameras, the only two static cameras in the whole of the Arndale!

Within the context of MMU, surveillance-through the mechanical eye of cctv-functions as crime prevention. A 24 hour witness that can't actually intervene however. It also raises the issue of privacy seeing the private moments of different individuals on the screens made me feel uncomfortable that a condition of modern life is that your private moments are no longer your own.  - Gwen Osmond, Manchester.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nBefore entering the CCTV control room I suddenly became nervous with a guilty gut feeling! I think the anticipation was provoked by my own acknowledgement that I have until this point, successfully ignored and repressed my awareness CCTV. The guilt came out of entering the space behind the cameras which I had previously labelled as deceptive, invasive and even useless due to past experiences. I didn't want to be that person spying on everyone else through a camera. My academic background and theoretical interests in Foucault and Virilio motivated me to participate in this project as a great opportunity to experience first hand what it is like to be behind the camera which has produced such controversy and interest within society. It is amazing how a camera can produce such political, social, psychological and artistic interest. Ironically my experience was actually quite mundane. The illusion of the invasive surveillance camera was shattered the moment I stepped into the CCTV room when I was confronted by friendly faces with mugs of coffee on a long day shift just doing their job. They are human beings after all, with moral and ethical consciousness, observing abnormalities with the intension of prevention and protection against criminal behaviour.  - Sarah Jamison, Manchester.<br /><br />\r\nLonger video, transcription, annotation and torrent download:<br />\r\n<a href='http://pad.ma/Vfc3nh5d/info'>http://pad.ma/Vfc3nh5d/info</a>",

Julie talks about young kids on estates having no respect for the elderly and is corrected by Steve who pointedly tells her that kids at Uni can be just as offensive. Soon the discussion moves to the pubs (as seen on CCTV) around the Uni and the near complete gentrification of the place, the resentment amongst locals who can no longer visit their local pub since its now 'student-only'. In a subtle reversal of subjectivities, we hear first hand from the security guards about the rapid gentrification of the city, 'Picadilly gardens used to be beautiful.

        "description": "On Sunday afternoon I was lucky enough to spend some time at the surveillance nerve centre of Manchester University. The film was being created by an Asian woman called Shaina Anand, whom I knew nothing about. \\The form the documentary took was to let people i.e. people like me, into the surveillance room where all the TV screens were stationed and allow me to ask questions to the people whose job it was to monitor the screens. It was an eye opener in every sense of the term. They can see everything that's happening in the surrounding streets from that little room in stunning clarity; so-much-so that it would be practically impossible to do anything undetected by the beady eye of the CCTV cameras.<br />\r\n\r\nIt was funny but the thing that broke the ice was a comment I made, 'Wow! This is like something from 1984' (cliched I know), but I had to hide a chuckle when Joe, one of the two operators, said without a hint of irony 'No, all this equipment is only ten years old'. Whether that gives a hint to the calibre of person whose job it is to spy on/police the streets I don't know, but it certainly gave me one. And that really was the problem; I couldn't for the life of me trundle out all the arguments about how this snooping encroaches on civil liberties as well as personal freedoms, or why every citizen has now become someone with the potentiality for criminality. These were two working Joes, except one was called Pete, who were earning a wage by doing what they were told to do. So I spent the hour I had asking them about what they knew best, their job. I should add that whilst all this was happening I had two cameras trained on me which at first made me feel a little uncomfortable, but the frightening bit is just like the people we watched on the streets outside, eventually I forgot they were there. - Philip King, Manchester.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nLonger video, transcription, annotation and torrent download:<br />\r\n\r\n<a href='http://pad.ma/Vu5o965c/info'>http://pad.ma/Vu5o965c/info</a>",
